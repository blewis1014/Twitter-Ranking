Raw carrot, tumeric and ginger soup
2 cups of carrot pulp
4 cups of oats
(or 3 cups of oats and 1 cup of flaked almond/ chopped almonds/ almond powder)
2 cups of date paste (soak dates in hot water then blend till pastey)
1 cup of raisins
1 cup of cacao nibs
1/2 cup of maple (taste after you add, you may like it sweeter)
2 tsp of cinnamon
1 tsp of clove powder
2 tsp of ginger powder
I suggest doing the mixing by hand as it gives you more differentiated texture. Chuck your date paste and maple in with the pulp, oats, almonds, cacao nibs and raisins as well as spices and plough that mother down until you have a dough. Press it into a lined over tray then refrigerate. A few hours should do the trick.
Make a quick raw ganache:
1/4 cup melted virgin coconut oil (GOOD fat!)
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 – 1 cup of raw cacao powder (this is available in Taiwan and please don’t cut corners, get this. Hershey’s is NOT raw!)
Whisk all three together, pour the ganache over then set in the fridge once again. The cut, remove from the oven tray onto a board and slice into squares.
Enjoy!
