Full Description
Command and Conquer Red Alert gives you the opportunity to be more devious, cunning and ruthless than ever before. Easy to play and addictive fun, Red Alert puts the fate of the world in your hands.
The sequel to Command & Conquer, Red Alert literally rips up the history books, telling the story of a World War II in which the Soviet Empire, not Hitler's Nazis, threaten the peace of the free world.
Repelling the onslaught requires the perfect combination of deep thinking for a long-term strategic war and razor sharp reflexes for real-time combat. Red Alert boasts 30 new gameplay features over C&C, including thieves, medics, attack dogs, spies, land mines, paratroopers, submarines and enhanced AI. Red Alert is also compatible with PlayStation mouse and is linkable so you can join two PlayStations together for two player head-to-head action.
