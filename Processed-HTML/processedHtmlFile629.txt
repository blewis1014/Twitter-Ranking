Come Talk To Mama
By Tiffany Abreu & Samantha Nickerson
Have you ever met two individuals who emulated the same energy of Thing 1 and Thing 2 from “Cat In The Hat”? No? Well we exist, and we’re here to listen. This is a show brought to you by Tiffany Abreu and Samantha Nickerson, where we navigate the boundaries of communication, and sharing the knowledge we’ve gathered from the 19 long years we’ve had on this earth. We want to let you into the crazy world that doesn’t exist beyond our brains, and see what you can take from it. We want to help you, help us, help you. We will be discussing several topics, while we giggle through it all. Now come talk to mama.    Cover Created By: Noel Sanchez
