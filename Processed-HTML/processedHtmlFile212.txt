After an entire season of shoving woke, anti-police, “social justice” issues down the throats of basketball fans, is it any surprise the NBA’s ratings completely plummeted for the last game of the finals?
Breitbart reports that viewership for the sixth and final game of the NBA finals this year drew 6.028 million viewers. Last year, the final game had 18.34 million viewers–translating to a 66 percent viewership decline in 2020.
“The NBA restarted its season, after a five-month hiatus due to the coronavirus, by making social justice messaging and imagery a centerpiece of their television broadcasts,” writes Breitbart. “That messaging was greeted with historic drops in ratings, drops largely due to fan dissatisfaction with the overtly political nature of the games.”
Before the season started in July, many NBA players were participating in and/or voicing their support for the Black Lives Matter protests across the country. As the season began, many players wore t-shirts and masks with “Black Lives Matter” written on them. The NBA even painted “Black Lives Matter” across basketball courts.
As if that weren’t enough, 300 of the 350 NBA players this season also wore jerseys with “social justice” messages emblazoned on them. The messages included: Black Lives Matter, Say Their Names, Vote, I Can’t Breathe, Justice, Peace, Equality, Freedom, Enough, Power to the People, Justice Now, Say Her Name, Sí Se Puede (Yes We Can), Liberation, See Us, Hear Us, Respect Us, Love Us, Listen, Listen to Us, Stand Up, Ally, Anti-Racist, I Am A Man, Speak Up, How Many More, Group Economics, Education Reform and Mentor.
So, what will the 2021 NBA season look like?
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last week he believes there will be a “return to normalcy” for next season and that the social justice messages will “largely be left to be delivered off the floor.”
“And, I understand those people who are saying, ‘I’m on your side, but I want to watch a basketball game,” he continued.
Could it be the NBA has actually learned a valuable lesson from the school of “Get woke, go broke?”
