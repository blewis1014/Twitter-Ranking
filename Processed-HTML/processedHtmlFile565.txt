Cardiff City have signed Wales forward Harry Wilson on loan for the rest of the season from Liverpool.
Wilson, 23, attracted interest from a number of Championship clubs ahead of Friday's transfer deadline.
Swansea City were also in talks over Wilson but they were unable to agree a deal with the Premier League champions.
Wrexham-born Wilson, who has been capped 19 times by Wales, had been close to a permanent move to Burnley earlier this month.

But the window for deals between English top-flight clubs had already closed.
The winger is keen for game-time before next summer's delayed Euro 2020, played Premier League football for Bournemouth last season. He scored seven goals as Eddie Howe's side were relegated.
Wilson had a successful loan spell in the Championship with Derby County in 2018-19, scoring 18 goals as the Rams reached the play-offs under Frank Lampard.
Cardiff had been interested in a deal for Barnsley forward Cauley Woodrow, but manager Neil Harris has said permanent deals were unlikely before the deadline because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
