Item Description
If you know someone who loves dogs, or are a dog lover yourself, the one of a kind MUST LOVE DOGS earrings are a perfect jewelry gift!  The unique earrings feature colorful artisan created lampwork glass beads with dog paw prints / pawprints, Czech glass beads and sterling silver..  The two sided lampwork glass beads are coin shaped, created from turquoise blue glass with frit dots in shades of amber and dark brown.  The lampwork coins would be beautiful by themselves, but whimsical dog paw prints made from terracotta orange glass were applied to each side of the beads for eye catching appeal. One set of pawprints point straight up and the other set points at an angle.  To add even more interest and texture, dots of metallic copper glass were carefully applied to the edge of the paw print beads.  The metallic glass dots might be small, but as you can see in the photos, they have a subtle sparkle when the light hits them just right.  Since the pawprints beads are handmade, they are very similar but not exactly the same - something that people who value handmade jewelry absolutely love. Because the lampwork beads are two sided, the earrings look fabulous from any angle when worn.
 
Because the paw print beads are so beautiful in their own right, simple accents were used.  Perfectly highlighting the beads, a faceted round Czech glass bead in shades of turquoise and brown were added to the top and bottom, separated by small sterling silver daisy spacers.  Sterling silver French hook earwires finish the unique earrings.  Carefully designed and handmade by Catherine of Shadow Dog Designs, the MUST LOVE DOGS paw print earrings were created for the woman who loves her dog(s) and wants the world to know!
 
 
Lampwork paw print beads:  app. 15 mm x 10 mm (0.6” x 0.4”); artisan handmade by Karen Leonardo
Czech glass beads:  app. 5 mm
Metal:  sterling silver
Earwires:  sterling silver French hooks
Length:  app. 1.75” / 4.5 cm measured from the top curve of the earwires
 
*** For a better understanding of the relative size of the MUST LOVE DOGS handmade dog paw print earrings, please be sure to check out photo # 6 for a size comparison with a dime.
 
Dogs are a symbol of loyalty, friendship and unconditional love.  Even though man made, glass carries the energies of transformation, rebirth and communication. Silver is a metal of love and healing; it is a mirror to the soul, helping us to see ourselves as others see us.. 
 
The MUST LOVE DOGS artisan dog lover earrings were carefully designed and handmade in a dog friendly, smoke free studio. They will be carefully packed in an organza jewelry bag with tissue, perfect for gift giving to a loved one . . . or to yourself!
 
***  The jewelry in my shop is photographed outside in natural light.  Please be aware that not all computer monitors show colors exactly the same. The colors of the components used to create each piece of jewelry are extremely close to the actual color on my own monitor. They may appear lighter or darker on yours.
