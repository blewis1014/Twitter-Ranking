The Joe Biden campaign put some serious work into its island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons . The Democratic presidential nominee can be seen walking around his field office, a polling place, and much more in the meticulously designed 'Biden HQ.' He'll shout one of his campaign slogans, "no malarkey" if you speak to his character. And that's a fact, Jack.
"A lot of the residents on the island are dogs, Joe Biden loves dogs," said Kinda Funny's Greg Miller while exploring the island on Twitch. Kinda Funny debuted the town on their stream on October 16 by visiting it with the Dream Suite. Miller was joined by Animal Talking Host Gary Whitta . Whitta expanded into a show called Talk Guys recently, which takes place in the online multiplayer game Fall Guys .
Biden HQ's Polling Place
The island has Joe Biden yard signs , a field office with a basement full of trains (one of Joe Biden's nicknames is 'Amtrak Joe' since he often commuted by train), a polling place with voter information, and an ice cream stand in front of Nook's Cranny. There are a lot of fun spaces on the island, including Joe Biden fliers (made with custom designs) on the ground in places.
Amtrak Joe and his trains
It's clear that whoever designed the island is a big fan of Animal Crossing. The back part of the Biden HQ is covered in dog houses (turned around so they look like houses in the distance) and windmills. It's a common design trick that makes islands feel bigger in the Animal Crossing community.
Biden HQ's View
You can visit Biden HQ in Animal Crossing by laying down in bed to open the Dream Suite and entering the code DA-7286-5710-7478. You won't be able to take anything from the island, but you can text “AC” to 30330 to get a special Biden campaign shirt for your villager.
President Trump doesn't have an Animal Crossing: New Horizons island yet and with the election fast approaching he better get on that. Terraforming takes a long time. Both candidates had individual town halls this week to talk to voters about social justice, climate change, and other issues. This took the place of a traditional debate.
