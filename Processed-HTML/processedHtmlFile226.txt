Teams Most Likely to Trade Up
Charlotte Hornets
While it's rarely (if ever) recommended for teams to consider roster needs early in the draft, the ideal prospect scratches a specific need without necessitating a reach. That could easily be the case with Charlotte and big man James Wiseman.
The Hornets need a long-term solution at center. They only have one center under contract for next season, and it's the decidedly unspectacular Cody Zeller. Even if they like him, he's 28 years old and only signed through 2020-21, so they'll need a succession plan at the 5 sooner than later.
Wiseman looks like the ideal target. He's a wildly intriguing prospect—last summer's top overall recruit, per 247Sports —with drool-worthy physical tools. As a 7'1" center with impressive athleticism, he can immediately plug into a rim-running role. Over time, he may offer focal-point potential if he expands his scoring range out past the three-point arc.
Charlotte has the option of sitting with fingers crossed and hoping that Wiseman falls in its lap at No. 3. But if the Hornets think he's the best prospect available for them, they may not want to chance it. Even if the Timberwolves and Warriors aren't thrilled with what the Hornets have to offer, there should be three-team trade possibilities where a third team collects the third pick and sends some win-now support to Minnesota or Golden State.
                   
New York Knicks
This feels like recycled analysis, since we're saying it every year, but the Knicks are star-searching again . While they could explore the trade route to find one— Chris Paul ? Zach LaVine?—their team dynamics suggests they should take a more future-focused approach.
The most important players in their rebuild are 20-year-old RJ Barrett and 22-year-old Mitchell Robinson. While they might benefit from having a veteran leader to follow, they could gain a lot more from being joined by a high-level prospect who grows alongside them.
The draft-lottery gods didn't help by saddling them with the No. 8 pick, which puts them well outside the draft range of their presumed target: LaMelo Ball. For a team in need of an offensive identity and trying to solve a seemingly perpetual problem at point guard, the 6'7" floor general could be a godsend.
"LaMelo would bring excitement back to Madison Square Garden, but more importantly, he's an elite-level passer who can jump-start the Knicks' bland offense and make the game easier for RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson," B/R's Jonathan Wasserman wrote.
Ball's star power (seen most clearly in his 5.6 million Instagram followers) is perfect for the Big Apple, and his comfort pushing the pace could power up their 27th-ranked offense .
               
San Antonio Spurs
These aren't your slightly older sibling's Spurs anymore.
Long regarded as the Association's model of consistency (for good reason), they finally missed the playoffs for the first time since 1997. Their development-focused approach to the season's restart may signal a willingness to reset around their youth, and while they have a handful of interesting prospects, the collection is perhaps without a centerpiece.
If San Antonio sees that player in this draft, it could have an opportunity to go get him. The Spurs have an abundance of plug-and-play veterans entering their final season under contract—DeMar DeRozan (player option), LaMarcus Aldridge , Rudy Gay and Patty Mills—and if teams don't want to trade out of the draft, San Antonio could add the No. 11 pick to a deal.
The Spurs don't have any roster roadblocks in front of any of this draft's top prospects. Ball could walk into the primary playmaking role. Anthony Edwards might have as good of a chance as anyone to become its top scorer. Wiseman could supplant Jakob Poeltl, a restricted free agent, as the franchise's building-block big man.
The organization would have to move away from a long-held desire for maximum competitiveness, but that process seemingly got started in Orlando.
