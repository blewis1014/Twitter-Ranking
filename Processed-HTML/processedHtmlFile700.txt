What a beautiful beautiful transaction and the kindness that you have bestowed and with all the expertise I could never say enough I want to thank you for offering your treasures here because I think my grandma mama would have loved this... I don't know how many tapestry handbags she had but I do remember how much she loved them.  I cannot believe how big they were when I was just a little girl. now I understand more than ever after receiving this handbag today I appreciate your kindness your communication and packing and greatest thing of all  selling to me it just makes me feel like a cozy feeling inside because it makes me think of my grandma mama. Thank you very much and have a blessed day / anyone there I highly recommend.  being treated with kindness
