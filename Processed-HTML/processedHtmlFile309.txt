The president’s liabilities are spelled out in dozens of documents, published here.
No aspect of Donald Trump’s business has been the subject of more speculation than his debt load. Lots of people believe the president owes $400 million, especially after Trump seemed to agree with that figure on national television Thursday night. In reality, however, he owes more than $1 billion. 
The loans are spread out over more than a dozen different assets—hotels, buildings, mansions and golf courses. Most are listed on the financial disclosure report Trump files annually with the federal government. Two, which add up to an estimated $447 million, are not.
It is important to note, as Trump did Thursday night, that he also has significant assets. Forbes values them at $3.66 billion, enough to make his net worth an estimated $2.5 billion. He is not broke, despite what many critics claim.
Some people also like to suggest that Deutsche Bank is the only institution willing to lend to Trump. That’s not true. The president’s creditors include at least six other institutions, two of which began or reworked deals while the president was in office.  
One reason for all the confusion: Trump’s loans are not fully transparent. It’s still unclear to whom he owes an estimated $162 million against his skyscraper in San Francisco, for example. The loan against 1290 Avenue of the Americas is also something of a mystery. And it’s difficult to pin down the amount the president owes on a loan tied to his Bedford, New York, mansion. When asked about all of this, the Trump Organization did not respond.  
Here’s what we know—and don’t know—about the president’s debt.
1290 Avenue of the Americas
What Trump owes: $285 million
Who is the creditor: Unclear (see below)
When it’s due: November 2022
Interest rate: 3.34%
The documents:
Trump’s business partner, Vornado, details the loan against 1290 Avenue of the Americas. The accompanying 2012 document lists the original lenders that supplied Trump and Vornado with $950 million.
Donald Trump owns a 30% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which might explain why he does not list its debt on the financial disclosure report he files annually with federal ethics officials. Trump’s share of the debt on the building appears to be the largest liability in his entire portfolio. In 2012, he and his business partner, Vornado Realty Trust, got a $950 million loan from four financial institutions: Deutsche Bank, UBS, Goldman Sachs and the state-owned Bank of China. It is not clear exactly who holds the debt today. The Bank of China told Politico that it had sold off its portion of the loan.
Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.
What Trump owes: Est. $170 million
Who is the creditor: Deutsche Bank
When it’s due: Sometime in 2024
Interest rate: Variable
The documents:
Trump's financial disclosure report lists information about his debt in D.C. This mortgage document shows the original principal amount of $170 million.
Trump funded his redevelopment of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which now serves as the Trump International Hotel, with a $170 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank. It’s possible that Trump does not still owe all of that money today—the New York Times , which has access to Trump’s tax-return data, recently reported that the loan has a balance of $160 million. Regardless of the exact amount of principal outstanding, it doesn’t appear that the hotel is doing well enough to cover the interest expenses with profits from the business.  
  
What Trump owes: Est. $162 million
Who is the creditor: Unclear (see below)
When it’s due: September 2021
Interest rate: 5.1%
The document:
Because Vornado is publicly traded, it shares detailed information about its buildings, including 555 California Street, where Trump has a 30% stake.
Trump also owns a 30% stake alongside Vornado in 555 California Street, a skyscraper in downtown San Francisco. The partners have been paying down the loan, but they might make changes to it soon. In June, Vornado announced that it was considering whether to recapitalize 555 California Street and 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Any transaction involving those two buildings could have a huge effect on Trump’s business, given that his stakes in the two properties are his most valuable assets .  
40 Wall Street
What Trump owes: $138 million
Who is the creditor: Ladder Capital
When it’s due: July 6, 2025
Interest rate: 3.665%
The documents:
Trump's financial disclosure document lays out basic information about his loan at 40 Wall Street.
The 40 Wall Street loan was broken up into several different notes, detailed here and below.
These SEC documents provide more detail on Trump's monthly payments and his remaining balance.
The SEC documents also confirm information on Trump's disclosure, like the interest rate and maturity date.
Weeks after announcing his initial presidential run, Trump refinanced his skyscraper in downtown Manhattan, borrowing $160 million. He has been paying down the debt ever since, but he still owes $138 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Trump National Doral
What Trump owes: Est. $125 million
Who is the creditor: Deutsche Bank
When it’s due: Sometime in 2023
Interest rate: Variable
The documents:
Trump took out two separate mortgages against his famed Doral golf resort in Miami.
The president's financial disclosure report provides detailed information on his variable-interest loans, like these two at Doral.
Trump got a $106 million mortgage against his Miami golf resort from Deutsche Bank in 2012, at the time that he purchased the property. In August 2015, shortly after Trump launched his presidential bid, he got a second loan against Doral, this time for $19 million. It’s possible that his debt on the property is now more than the $125 million combined value of the mortgages. The New York Times reported last month that Trump’s balance totals $148 million.
Trump Tower
What Trump owes: $100 million
Who is the creditor: Ladder Capital
When it’s due: September 6, 2022
Interest rate: 4.2%
The documents:
The first liability listed on Trump's disclosure describes the loan behind his most iconic building, Trump Tower.
The president's loan at Trump Tower requires no principal payments. That's nice for now, but it means the president will need to come up with $100 million in 2022.
Trump took out a $100 million, interest-only loan against his signature Fifth Avenue tower in 2012. The property kicked off $13.3 million of net operating income in 2019, more than enough to cover the roughly $4.2 million Trump owes in annual interest expenses. Paying back the $100 million principal, due in two years, could be more complicated.
Trump International Hotel & Tower (Chicago)
What Trump owes: More than $75 million
Who are the creditors: Deutsche Bank, Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC
When it’s due: 2024 for part of it, unclear for the rest
Interest rate: Variable
The document:
Trump's financial disclosure report shows two liabilities against his tower in Chicago, including his ever-perplexing loan with Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC.
The debt against Trump’s Chicago tower includes the most confounding liability in his portfolio. In addition to a Deutsche Bank loan for what seems to be $45 million, there’s a loan of more than $50 million, from a creditor named Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC. Here’s where things gets confusing: Donald Trump owns Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC, so he’s lending money to himself. If one of his companies owes more than $50 million to another one of his companies, then the company lending the money should theoretically be worth more than $50 million. But Trump does not list any value for Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC on his financial disclosure report. All of this has befuddled investigative reporters from Mother Jones , the Washington Post and, yes, Forbes for years.
Trump Plaza
What Trump owes: $13 million
Who is the creditor: Ladder Capital
When it’s due: July 6, 2024
Interest rate: 3.85%
Ladder Capital has helped Trump borrow hundreds of millions of dollars through several transactions.
Trump is slowly paying off his debt at Trump Plaza, as this SEC document shows.
Through a company called Trump Plaza LLC, the president controls two brownstone apartment buildings, a garage and a strip of retail shops on Third Avenue in New York City. From 2017 to 2019, one of the tenants paying rent to Trump Plaza LLC was Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign .
Palm Beach, Fla. home
What Trump owes: Est. $11 million
Who is the creditor: Professional Bank
When it’s due: June 1, 2048
Interest rate: 4.5%
Trump borrowed $11.2 million from Professional Bank while in office.
The Professional Bank loan helped Trump buy his sister’s mansion, which sits near Mar-a-Lago.
This 30-year mortgage has the most distant maturity date of anything in the president’s portfolio.
Trump took out a 30-year, $11.2 million mortgage from Professional Bank on May 16, 2018, the day he purchased an $18.5 million home near Mar-a-Lago from his sister Maryanne Trump Barry.
Trump National Golf Club, Colts Neck
What Trump owes: Est. $11 million
Who is the creditor: Amboy Bank
When it’s due: Sometime in 2028
Interest rate: 5.25%
The documents:
Trump borrowed $18 million across two mortgages to help finance the purchase of a golf club in New Jersey.
Despite all the money Trump spent on the place, the Colts Neck club has proved to be a disappointment.
His lender on the property is a local New Jersey institution named Amboy Bank, as the president's financial disclosure report shows.
Trump purchased a golf club in Colts Neck, New Jersey, for $28 million in 2008, borrowing $18 million from a local institution called Amboy Bank. In 2019, the club produced just $7.6 million of revenue , suggesting it’s now worth about half of what Trump paid for it. Forbes estimates he still owes roughly $11 million on the property.
Trump Park Avenue
What Trump owes: Est. $10 million
Who is the creditor: Investors Savings Bank
When it’s due: Sometime in 2020
Interest rate: 3.25%
The documents:
The debt against Trump Park Avenue is one of the president's cheapest loans, with an interest rate of just 3.25%.
An employee inside the Trump Organization said that the loan had $9.8 million of principal left in February 2019.
The president’s financial disclosure report, which discloses assets and liabilities in broad ranges, lists the loan against Trump Park Avenue at $5 million to $25 million. Patrick Birney, who works in financial operations at the Trump Organization, said in February 2019 that the balance was just under $10 million. It’s possible that the principal is lower today.
Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C.
What Trump owes: Est. $7 million
Who is the creditor: Chevy Chase Trust Holdings
When it’s due: Sometime in 2029
Interest rate: 5.5%
The documents:
Of the ten traditional golf clubs in Trump's portfolio, only his properties in Colts Neck, New Jersey, and the D.C. suburbs have loans against them.
This document shows that the president took out $10 million to buy his golf course near Washington, D.C.
Trump took out a $10 million loan in 2009, when he bought a golf course near his future home for $13 million. Forbes estimates its principal outstanding is now more like $7 million. With a 5.5% interest rate, it’s one of Trump’s priciest loans.
Trump International Hotel & Tower (NYC)
What Trump owes: $6 million
Who is the creditor: Ladder Capital
When it’s due: August 6, 2026
Interest rate: 4.05%
The documents:
Trump discloses a handful of smaller loans on his annual ethics filing, including this one against Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York City.
Trump chips away at this loan month-by-month, making payments of less than $50,000 to his lenders.
Five months before he was elected president, Donald Trump refinanced the debt against this tower on the corner of New York City’s Central Park.
Seven Springs
What Trump owes: $5-25 million
Who is the creditor: The Bryn Mawr Trust Company
When it’s due: Sometime in 2029
Interest rate: 4.5%
The document:
Trump's financial disclosure report describes his loan against Seven Springs, a mansion he owns in New York.
At some point last year, while the president was in office, the Trump Organization reworked the loan against his New York estate. The maturity date moved from 2019 to 2029, and the interest rate jumped from 4% to 4.5%. It’s unclear exactly how much the president still owes on the loan.
