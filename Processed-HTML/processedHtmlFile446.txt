A man is accused of attempting to burn a Seattle patrol vehicle with an officer inside. The officer suffered what have been described by police as minor burn injuries in the Thursday incident.
According to a blotter post, an officer was in a patrol car in an alley around 1:30 p.m. looking for a man reportedly brandishing a flaming piece of wood.
The officer found the man, who threw the flaming piece of wood into the car while the officer was inside, the police said.
As the suspect was being arrested by backup officers, the car caught on fire from the piece of wood.
“It was an incredibly dangerous situation for our officer. He did suffer some minor injuries, some minor burn wounds,” Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette told KIRO .
