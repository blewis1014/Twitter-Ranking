My name is Ruria Raw (or Ruria, if you prefer).
I’m a 3DX Artist based in Europe.
If I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m ambitious and hypercritical but only of myself.
That’s why I constantly study and experiment with new technologies paying special attention to the feedback I receive because people get better if they question themselves continuously.
My mission, that is pure energy and unstoppable enthusiasm for my soul, is to create AweAweAweSome projects, totally NSWF.
I started this Patreon for a very simple reason: I need money.
I’m doing another job to pay my bills and this prevents me from devoting all my time to this activity
I want to create at my own pace, without compromises
Software licenses cost an arm and a leg
What can I offer you in addition to my everlasting gratitude and love?
High-quality content, always diverse and made with attention to the smallest detail.
Details are my obsession… My precious!
Even if you decide not to support me, I won’t leave you behind.
Art (or whatever it is) must be free.
That’s why you can find some of my works on these websites:
