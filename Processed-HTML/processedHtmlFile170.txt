Jon Michael Salter breaks down three wide receiver talents the Eagles should call and check on before the trade deadline.
If you are a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles , you know that one of the biggest issues, the birds have had, has been the wide-out position. Despite fielding legit talent, the Eagles offense, can’t seem to get any of them on the field. Be it injuries, or the player just doesn’t pan out, it is clear the birds passing game is snake bitten. GM Howie Roseman has drafted many WR’s over the last few years, aside from this year’s crop (too early to tell), have all been a miss. This year’s draft was a step in the right direction, after selecting Jalen Reagor, out of TCU, as well as free agent gem, Travis Fulgham. After those two, it gets a bit murky, when it comes to youth. With that said, I decided to find 3 young WR prospects , the front office should consider trading for.
Jalen Guyton, Los Angeles Chargers.
The former University of North Texas, stand out, isn’t the biggest name, but it isn’t anything to do with skill. It is more of a depth issue, as Guyton serves at best the number 3 spot, in the Chargers, offense (Keenan Allen, Mike Williams). All that aside, the kid is the real deal. Capable of playing all three WR spots, the 6’1 215 LB, stud, can do it all. He plays with a legit strength over the middle, catching with strong hands, and doesn’t shy away from contact. Even more impressive is his skill set when running routes. He has a complete tree and can separate at the top of routes, making it easier for a QB. He has legit speed and can serve as a deep threat. The kid from Allen, TX, is built to be a real playmaker, and if the Eagles, could land him, would help boost a team that lacks talent.
Equanimeous St. Brown, Green Bay Packers.
At 6’5 215 LBs, the former 6th round pick out of Notre Dame, not only looks the part, but is a real talent. Talk about an issue at the catch point, St. Brown, has the talent to be the new Alshon Jefferey, the one Eagles fans expected, when they signed him. Although his stats don’t stand out, watch the tape, and you will see a young playmaker, capable of taking over games. Finally heathy for the season, St. Brown, looks to be a huge contributor to the Packers, offense. Adding a talent like St. Brown, could give the Eagles real depth, and a WR harder to cover, then it is pronounce his name. The birds should take a shot, as they will endure little risk, but plenty of reward.
David Moore, Seattle Seahawks.
Watching the tape on Moore, it is easy to fall in love. For those of us that remember Jeremy Maclin, you could see a slight resemblance in Moore’s play. Quick in and out of breaks, the 6 ft., 200 pounders, has the ability to be a game-changer. Blessed with good speed, to separate on routes, and strong hands to fight for contested passes, Moore is pure talent. The lesser-known would-be star is stuck behind superstar DK Metcalf and all world Tyler Lockett, so it is easy to overlook the kid. But watch the game tape, and he jumps off the screen, weekly. Adding a talent like Moore would give the Eagles, another monster, that could help turn the passing game into, an NFC terror.
I would love to hear your thoughts on these three? what do you think? who are some young Wide-outs, you would like to see the Eagles front office trade for?
