Everton Vs. Liverpool Preview: Merseyside Derby Team News And Predicted Lineups
The Knicks pick at Nos. 8 and 27 and are in the market for a point guard. They have been linked to multiple point guards in the draft — LaMelo Ball, Killian Hayes, Cole Anthony and Lewis — as well as several free-agents — Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, D.J. Augustin and Fred VanVleet.
“It was a good interview, they got great people,” Lewis said. “It was a very comfortable interview, I could sit back and have a good time. Playing with those young guys [R.J. Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, etc.], it would be good because I know they like to compete. Being able to add what I could on offense and on the defensive side as well, I feel like it will be a good system to be in with those guys.”
Cory Underwood, the former Forest Hills High School star who has trained Lewis, thinks Lewis could be a good fit with the Knicks.
“There’s probably a lot of pressure [in New York] to draft LaMelo Ball or another popular guard — but I think he makes a lot of sense roster-wise,” Underwood told Ian Begley of SNY.tv.
Lewis is a speedster who can push the tempo and Underwood said that will help his game translate to the NBA.
“He’s so great at...being unpredictable,’ he said. “His speed in transition or delayed transition is going to be huge.”
Said Lewis: “I feel like [my speed] is a major component because everybody wants to get out and create easy buckets and create easy opportunities for easy shots, so having my speed and being able to get the ball from one end of the court to the other in a fast and short amount of time is a very important thing in the league and I feel the league is transforming into more of a play-fast kind of league instead of kind of slowing it down. When they have to slow it down, they will, but most of the time they try to score and get as many possessions as they can, so I feel that will be one thing that really transitions well into this next level.”
Lewis has also met twice with the Suns, who pick at No. 10.
“Yeah, I just had my second one recently this week,” he said of Phoenix. “Just coming in, really taking advice from the older guards like [Ricky] Rubio and learning from their experience and then adding my game to what they do. Trying to create for players like Devin Booker, I feel like it would be a great fit because they might need somebody who can contribute for them and get them open shots and make it easy on a superstar like Devin Booker.
“I feel like I can come in and contribute and play off the ball as well, and do what I do.”
Multiple mocks — including Forbes and The Ringer — have Lewis going No. 14 to Boston, but Lewis said, “I haven’t met with them yet.”
Wherever he goes, Lewis feels he can help a team immediately with his speed and willingness to push the tempo, combined with his tenacity and ability to get steals and blocks on defense.
“Just a dynamic guard that can do a little bit of everything, shoot, pass, dribble, create for other teammates,” he said. “Use my speed to my advantage. I also put a couple of pounds on so I can be able to take hits and finish or stay on course when I’m in the lane.
“On the defensive end, just using my quickness to cut offensive players off and just keep going and getting better every season that I’m in the league.”
Now he just has to get that suit ready for draft night.
