Ghosts of Tsushima Legends, not what I was hoping for, underwhelmed. Patch 1.12
#1
So I just installed the 1.12 update, turns out it's just a wave based combat game. Where you press L1 every time an enemy attacks to parry then mash Square, or you press O to dodge unblockables and then mash square, that's it, that's the game. Then you sprint to a circle, stand in it, and repeat the process. Can't say I'm interested in having another go unless someone wants to explain why that gameplay loop is so good and how doing the same thing over and over is super fun? The interaction between team mates seems quite low, outside of the ronin's healing ability. The colour palette is overblown with super bright red, bright blue and random colour effects fighting for your eyes attention it lacks all of the subtly that made the main game so good.
