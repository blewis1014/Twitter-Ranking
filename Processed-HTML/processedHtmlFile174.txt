"I am very proud of David and his commitment to self-growth," Irving's Lawyer Daniel Moskowitz said in a text message to the media. "This is a story of redemption."
Irving was already due to become a free agent, and not likely to be re-signed by the Cowboys even without the suspension.
In his four seasons in Dallas, Irving's raw talent was a force of nature at times on the field. However, Irving could never quite get passed the NFL's policy on marijuana usage, taking to his instagram to announce his intentions to step away from the game until things changed.
"Basically, guys, I quit," Irving said in the post. "I know they're talking about a suspension and all this other nonsense. I'm out of there. I'm not doing this s--- no more."
In 37 games with Dallas, Irving had 12.5 sacks, 30 quarterback hits, 17 tackles for loss, 12 pass deflections and five forced fumbles.
