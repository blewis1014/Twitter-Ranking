No matter which way you look at it, the first Presidential debate was a disaster.  There was no winner, but there was a clear loser: the American people. 
With free speech hanging in the balance, America deserves better than a biased and weak moderator like Chris Wallace.  America also deserves to listen to the candidates answer complex questions in more than two minute sound bites.
Please SIGN this urgent petition to the Commission on Presidential Debates and urge them to select former Navy SEAL Commander Jocko Willink as moderator for another presidential debate.
Let's think outside the box. Most Americans listen to long format podcasts. So let's ditch the ridiculous idea that you can communicate complex policy answers in 60 seconds and instead allow the candidates to speak.  And while we are at it, let's look to someone outside the political talking-head world to moderate this badly needed long format debate!
That is why we are calling on one of America's top podcaster, a man who has devoted most of his life to serving his country, to come to its aid once again.  Help us draft decorated Navy Seal Commander Jocko Willink to moderate a long-format debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
PLEASE SIGN OUR PETITION TO DRAFT JOCKO WILLINK TO MODERATE A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
The corporate legacy media and the Big Tech monopolies cannot be trusted. When the survival of civil society hangs in the balance who could be better to rely on than Retired Navy Seal Commander Jocko Willink?
Besides being a decorated military hero, Jocko Willink happens to also be a gifted communicator, and his Jocko Podcast is in the Top 100 podcasts on Apple's Top Charts.
Jocko Willink embodies the non-partisan spirit of America's greatest president, George Washington and as such is much more likely to conduct an interesting and informative debate on issues that are actually important to the Amerian people, rather than cater to the hyper-polarized corporate legacy media monopolies.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Help us draft retired Navy Seal Commander Jocko Willink to host a real presidential debate where the two candidates are given direct unbiased questions and then allowed sufficient time to answer them.
PLEASE SIGN OUR PETITION TO DRAFT JOCKO WILLINK and feel free to contact him by leaving comments on his Twitter account: @jockowillink
With the shocking mainstream and social media blackout of any information that could damage Joe Biden's campaign as well as the revelations that the second presidential debate moderator, Steve Scully was coordinating with anti-Trump politico Anthony Scaramucci, we need to think outside the box.
Please SIGN our petition to draft Jocko Willink. Thank you!
