NFL Week 6 GPP PICKS FOR DRAFTKINGS AND FANDUEL
October 16, 2020
Welcome to my Week 6 GPP picks for DraftKings and FanDuel! My sole focus here is to help you identify options we can use in large field GPPs as well as Single Entry tournaments. Did you know all Ronin members receive $20 in credit to use at Fantasy Cruncher every month they sub with us?  Subscribe HERE ! Now, let’s dig in!
QUARTERBACK
RYAN FITZPATRICK – (Draftkings $5900, Fanduel $7400)
Thanks to bye weeks, prime time games, reshuffled schedules, and unfortunate injuries it’s shaping up to be a Ryan Fitzpatrick week. According to the Rise or Fall Study Hub Fitz is currently projected to be the highest owned QB on the slate. He’s cheap, he’s in a great matchup and we just watched him torch the 49ers a week ago. Fitzpatrick projects as one of the top values on DraftKings in the Rise or Fall Study Hub!
Like I said, that’s a fantastic floor with room for more. The Jets have been a train wreck on defense allowing 32.3 points per game as you can see below from our NFL Study Hub.  The Jets are ripe for the picking and FitzMagic is in a perfect spot to take advantage. Fitz’s lowest points over the last four games were 25.2 DKpts. His highest, 30.6. Hovering in that range at his current price point should make us feel very comfortable. Not to mention the lack of a consistent run game should intensify that security. Over his last four games, Fitz has run for a total of 113yds and scored 2TDs. I expect QB ownership to be focused on Fitz but due to people paying up at skill positions it should remain flat. So don’t let high ownership scare you. Because this is one comedy of horrors Fitz should easily navigate through en route to helping you see dollar signs.
Stacking Options: I think you gotta go Fitzpatrick and Parker as the double stack here. People might lean towards Preston Williams after his big game against the 49ers. Before their game against San Francisco, Parker had been a focal point of the passing game getting targets of 8, 5, and 12. I’d stick with this stack as Fitz should have a good day passing the ball to his top option and bring it back with Jamison Crowder (More on him later). Our stack projections in the study hub show Tennesee as the third-best stack on the week. Let them lead you to glory.
RUNNING BACK
DAVID MONTGOMERY – (Draftkings $5800, Fanduel $5900)
David Montgomery is in a prime spot for a blow-up game this week as the Bears face the overachieving Carolina Panthers. Despite logging back to back 10 carry games Monty has received 14 total targets since Tarik Cohen went down. Opportunity is massive in a situation like this and with the Bears not adding a RB Montgomery is in a great spot to give us bellcow usage at a hefty discount. Montgomery projects as a good value play on both DraftKings and Fanduel in the NFL Study Hub.
On the other side of things, the Panthers have been bleeding receptions to opposing RBs. Going back to week 2 they’ve given up combined reception counts of 11 (Bucs), 13 (Chargers), 5 (Cardinals), and 6 (Falcons). In three of those games, the primary ball carriers were Leonard Fournette, Austin Ekeler, and Todd Gurley. They all combined for 283yds and 4TDs. Helping Monty’s cause is the fact that the Bears are road dogs. Playing from behind will present Montgomery with even more PPR opportunities. Sold yet? You should be. Let others be scared. Jump on this opportunity while it’s HOT HOT HOT!
Stacking Options: Even though the Bears are road dogs I like the contrarian idea of pairing Montgomery with the Bears D. The defense has been solid against QBs allowing the sixth-most fantasy points to the position and Teddy can be had throwing 3 picks over his last four games.
WIDE RECEIVER
JAMISON CROWDER – (Draftkings $6100, Fanduel $6600)
Up top, I mentioned Fitzpatrick as my QB pick and even how you should run his stack back with Crowder. Normally I’d just stop there. But what’s intriguing about Crowder is that while he’s the only Jet worth rostering his price has yet to reflect his production. In the three games he’s fully played, he’s finished with these stat lines; 7-11-1 on 13 targets, 7-104 on 10 targets, and 8-116-1 on 10 targets. The guy is balling, consistently. Though it is an extremely small sample it shows that no matter who the QB is he’s getting the job done. Crowder projects to be a better value on DraftKings than Fanduel in the NFL Study Hub but, is a great option for game stacking.
If you wanted to nitpick a little you could be concerned with the injection of Jeff Smith over the last two weeks and how he’s matched Crowder in targets (20). But Crowder is the focal point of getting this atrocious offense moving. He probably won’t command much attention because he plays on the Jets and Flacco is his QB. That’s the perfect opportunity for us to jump on this play. Crowder gives us a phenomenal floor to shoot for while having the potential for upside that could break a slate. Don’t let the J-E-T-S-L-O-L name scare you. Grab the production you want from a solid WR who can help you cash those dolla dolla bills y’all!
Stacking options: I did mention stacking Fitzpatrick and Parker with Crowder as a bring back option. But I’m not opposed to running a skinny stack of Crowder and Parker for correlation either. It’s a win-win.
TIGHT END
TJ HOCKENSON – (Draftkings $5300, Fanduel $5700 )
The Lions are back after their bye week and head to Jacksonville as (-3) road favorites with a game total of 54, tied for the second-highest total on the slate. THERE WILL BE POINTS. Working in the favor of Hockenson is the Jags weakness against TEs. Going back to week 2 they have been tagged by Jonnu Smith (4-84-2), Mike Gesicki (1-15-1), and Darren Fells (2-57-1). Previous to their bye week Hockenson wasn’t featured much in the offense with target counts of 4, 7, and 4. That can give one pause. But I bet that the Lions come out of the gate firing. The week off also helped alpha WR Kenny Golladay get healthier in a matchup that he should win and will help his TE get free. Looking at the GameFlow tab in the NFL Study Hub, we can see that the Jags D is giving up nearly 300 passing yards per game and 29.4 points per game. Hockenson should FEAST in this spot.
Stacking Options: As I alluded to earlier Stafford is in a great spot too. Stack up this strong duo and don’t be afraid to double stack it with Kenny Golladay. Heck, let’s get crazy and bring it back Laviska Shenault and take advantage of what’s should be a high scoring matchup.
Now let’s go build those lineups and win that money. Good luck everyone!
