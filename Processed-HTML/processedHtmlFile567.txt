MESQUITE - Quarterback Darrius White started his first game of the season and threw for four touchdowns to lead Mesquite Horn to a 41-27 victory over Tyler High.
White threw for 281 yards and completed 9 of 15 pass attempts. Wide receiver Xavier Brown caught three of those passes, and they went for 38-, 54-, and 71-yard touchdowns, respectively.
Horn jumped out to a lead that they would never lose when defensive back Charles Demmings returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown.
Tyler (0-3) was able to cut the lead down to 28-20 early in the second half, but Horn's defense clamped down soon after; a fourth down stop and a picked off a pass late in the fourth quarter sealed the win.
Horn improves their record to 2-2 with the win and will square off against district opponent North Mesquite next Friday.
