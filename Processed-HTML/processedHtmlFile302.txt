Trump declined such a forum, saying, “That’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It’s ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want.”
The debate was ultimately canceled after the moderator, C-SPAN host Steve Scully , posted a tweet last week publicly seeking the advice of Trump opponent Anthony Scaramucci.
Do you think Welker will be an impartial moderator?

The events of the last few weeks have called into question the debate commission’s integrity.
The third debate, which is being moderated by Welker, will be a test to see if the commission  can regain some semblance of impartiality.
The topics announced Friday raised questions about bias, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas noting on Twitter, “Conveniently, those are the titles of each of policy tabs Joe Biden’s campaign website.”
