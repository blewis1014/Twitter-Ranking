BREAKING: Floyd Mayweather Seals the Deal With Undefeated Prospect
The Lakers celebrated on Sunday night as they grabbed the Larry O’Brien championship trophy. It’s the fourth in counting for LeBron James after a well-fought season. He led his team to the goal with Anthony Davis on his side. However, the GOAT debate recently gained fresh momentum with this feat.
LeBron has been in the league for 17 years, and he continues to be incredible in his journey. The 2019-20 postseason was sheer class as he recorded a near triple-double of 25.3 points, 10.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds. Moreover, Bron clinched his fourth Finals MVP in a race ran by Davis.
The greatness of players extends with championships, and now there is a lot of chatter about LeBron with his recent title. The 35-year-old star has been often compared to the NBA legends like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant . Well, this discussion reached a higher notch after Lakers became the 2020 champions.
Bosh believes the difference in eras cannot compare LeBron James to MJ
The comparison has turned ugly at times, and LeBron, as a player, has faced immense criticism and love almost simultaneously. Amidst this, former Heat star Chris Bosh brought in his disappointment towards the same.
In his newsletter, ‘ The Last Chip ‘, Bosh writes that comparisons between Bron and MJ are “useless.”
“’Is it Bron?’ People ask. ‘MJ?’ Here’s why that’s a useless comparison: Those are two different players, playing two different games, at two completely different moments in time.”
The two-time NBA champion dismissed the idea of comparing two players from different eras, and outrightly calls it “disrespectful.”
“Talking about something as individualistic as the GOAT isn’t worthwhile—at worst, it’s downright disrespectful to the game. Disrespectful to everyone who plays it and everyone who came before them.”
NBA analysts, critics, and fans have made these debates reach new arguments. But Chris Bosh lashes at the media for making money out of such GOAT debates.
“I can’t act like the question [of GOAT] holds any weight the next time I hear it,” Bosh wrote. “If you’re looking to sell papers or get clicks, I promise there are better ways to do it.”
Well, this argument can stand true as numbers and figures make up a minute section of a player’s achievement. As Bosh suggested, “when you’re busy trying to figure out who the greatest is, it’s hard to see greatness itself.”
