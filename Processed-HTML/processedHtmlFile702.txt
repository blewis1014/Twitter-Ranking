Since 1977, Twombly has made several chariot-like sculptures . The theme reflects his fascination with the ancient world, particularly Homer's account of the Trojan War in The Iliad. This work is especially minimal , combining a simple disc and triangle to suggest the wheel and body of the chariot.
