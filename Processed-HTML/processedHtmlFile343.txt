Cut U​.​S. funding for animal tests in Wuhan, China & other foreign labs!
0 have signed. Let’s get to 15,000!
White Coat Waste Project started this petition to Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar
A new blockbuster White Coat Waste Project investigation revealed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sent millions of your tax dollars to the notorious Wuhan Institute of Virology for wasteful and dangerous experiments on coronavirus-infected bats and other animals...experiments that even put human health at risk.
Just one week after we released our international exposé, President Donald Trump went on national TV and promised he’d cut funding for these animal experiments in Wuhan!
Now we need your help telling the U.S. government to permanently end taxpayer funding for this Wuhan lab and all other animal testing in China and other foreign countries!
Want to know how else your money's been squandered? Let's just say the NIH is addicted to spending tens of millions of your tax money at foreign labs where animals are made to get hooked on drugs.
In recent years, Uncle Sam sent $11.6 million of your money to the U.K. to addict "junkie monkeys" to cocaine, morphine, and heroin, over $700,000 to hook zebrafish on nicotine, and $4.9 million to force pregnant mice to consume alcohol to cause birth defects.
It's time to just say no to this cruel and wasteful spending. Please join me and White Coat Waste Project in urging the U.S. government to cut funding for ALL animal experiments in foreign labs.
Sincerely,
