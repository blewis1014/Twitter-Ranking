Editors’ Notes BTS isn't your typical K-pop boy band: These guys prefer sexy slow jams to mushy ballads, and rap to pretty much anything else. Their songs come in just about every flavor of hip-hop, from thrashy rap-rock to classic G-funk. While they're best known for rhyming about social issues affecting youth, they also bring the same level of passion and wordplay to tunes about relationships or just having a good time.
