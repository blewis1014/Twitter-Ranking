The terrorist who beheaded the teacher near Paris, declared about the “executed dog of hell.” He wrote about this on his Twitter.
A user with the nickname Tchetchene_270 posted a photo of the severed head. He also turned to French President Emmanuel Macron, stating that he “executed the teacher who dared to humiliate the Prophet Muhammad.” The criminal's account is now blocked.
On October 16, it was reported that the terrorist could be born in Moscow. According to the BFMTV television channel, the killer is of Chechen origin, he is 18 years old. The nickname Tchetchene (“Chechen”) indirectly confirms this version. He did not come to the attention of the special services and did not appear in the dossiers of radicalized individuals. There was no official confirmation of this information, but Baza found out that the killer was 18-year-old Abdulak Anzorov. The criminal attacked the teacher for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during the lesson on freedom of speech.
Earlier, Emmanuel Macron called the murder of a history teacher a terrorist attack. According to the president, the French teacher died for “teaching children freedom of speech, freedom to believe or not to believe.”
Later it became known that as part of the investigation of the terrorist attack, four people were detained, including the criminal's relatives. It is clarified that all the detainees “belong to the close circle of friends” of the terrorist.
