Soul Station π: Isley Brothers 72-73
Jul 30, 2019
Today at the Soul Station, I present the Isley Brothers' Brother, Brother, Brother and 3+3 albums. I think these are two of their very best albums. Brother was the final studio release in their T-Neck deal with Buddah Records, though they had to give the label a double live set, too, which came out in March of 1973, almost one year after Brother. The Brother album isn't the first on which Ernie Isley plays rock influenced lead guitar, but in my estimation, it is the first one in which he is really successful and find his own way, even with many touches obviously borrowed from Hendrix. Overall the album balances the soul, funk and mighty dance grooves, with some searing guitar and perhaps the best vocal version of It's Too Late. Having moved to CBS, they reconfigured That Lady from a 1964, moody, latin inflected, brass driven track, to one featuring Ernie's searing and soaring lead guitar. Big difference, big hit. And while they continued to cover rock and pop tunes well associated with other artists and groups, the versions here of Summer Breeze and Listen To The Music really stand out! So be prepared to groove and connect with the Brothers Isley of 1972-73.
