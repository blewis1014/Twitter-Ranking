A campaign season tradition — the candidate debate — almost certainly won't happen in the high-profile race between Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy.
Hyde Smith told the Clarion Ledger on Wednesday she doesn't plan to debate, citing a busy schedule and "stark, drastic" differences between herself and Espy that she believes voters already know about.
She similarly declined to debate him and other challengers before her 2018 special election , though eventually agreed to one before the runoff against Espy, which she won by about eight points. 
"To be honest with you, the debate about debates, that is something that losing candidates and reporters care about," Hyde-Smith said in a phone interview. She said Mississippians are more interested in the issues themselves, such as the economy and coronavirus response, not hearing about whether a debate will occur.
At a news conference earlier in the day, Espy slammed Hyde-Smith for refusing to debate. 
"I think it is imperative that voters hear directly from Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, and directly from me, about where we stand on the important issues of Mississippi," Espy said, adding she is disrespecting Mississippi voters and "taking them for granted."

He said stark differences with Hyde-Smith is exactly why they should debate. "If you felt the same about views, programs or had a similar platform, you wouldn't have to debate anyone," Espy said. 
Espy said the campaign received two debate invitations. A campaign spokeswoman said WJTV-TV and WLBT-TV both invited the candidates to separate debates. Espy agreed to a pair of dates, one in August and one in September, and said he is willing to attend one before Nov. 3.

Hyde-Smith said the next few weeks are too busy. She said she will be back in Washington, D.C. early next week for much of the rest of the month due to the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett. 
But Espy pointed out that other high-profile Senate Republicans had recently found time to debate their challengers — including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Maine's Susan Collins.
Hyde-Smith argued she already debated Espy once in 2018, and little has changed since then regarding their positions. Voters are welcome to research her voting record, she said, both in the Senate and her previous stint in the Mississippi Legislature, to learn more about where she stands on issues. 
"I don't feel extremely compelled that the people of Mississippi think that it's really, really important," she said of a debate, adding it's "easy to see the differences" and labeling Espy as a liberal. She did not directly respond to a question about whether a debate might help voters better understand those policy differences. 
Marvin King, an Ole Miss political science professor, said Hyde-Smith may fear giving Espy's campaign too much oxygen that could come along with a strong debate performance by him, or weak performance by her, so late in the race.

"It does deny swing voters — such that we have any in the state — the opportunity to see them on the same stage, answering the same questions," King said. 
Nathan Shrader, a Millsaps College political science professor, said it is highly unusual for a debate not to occur in a competitive Senate race. He said the sharply contrasting views Hyde-Smith described are the most important reason to hold a debate, because it allows the candidates to "lay that vision out, side by side." 
Shrader said Hyde-Smith may be generally uncomfortable with debating after the 2018 event against Espy , which he said did not go well for her. She departed without answering reporters' questions and instead sent her colleague, Sen. Roger Wicker, to speak with the press about her performance. 
"It's just not in her wheelhouse," Shrader said.
