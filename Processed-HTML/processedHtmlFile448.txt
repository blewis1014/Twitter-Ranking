Video games are all the rage, so we decided to shed some light on local video game stars in the Carolinas. This week, we had the chance to sit down with local community gamer, Eric Flowe, and ask him about being part of the gaming community! Fun fact: Eric is also a student currently at Johnson C. Smith University here in Charlotte, North Carolina!
How did you get into gaming? What was the original goal?
I became involved in gaming due to my prestigious Johnson C. Smith University’s Esports Club! The club was brilliant in marketing its efforts and recruiting potential gamers. Also, the club has seen success in games such as Call of Duty and Fortnite. However, my original goal was to minor in the Esports and Game Management program offered at JCSU and build a career in event planning and operations.
What’s been your best moment as a gamer?
My best moment as a gamer was being a part of history! My HBCU(Johnson C. Smith University Golden Bulls) is the first HBCU University to offer Esports and Gaming Management as a course. Additionally, bringing further attention to my community by promoting the HBCU Gaming initiative.
What games really speak to you?
Call of Duty and Fortnite! These games provide the skills of hand-eye coordination, teamwork, and cooperation to compete professionally.
What advice would you give to aspiring gamers?
Practice! Practice makes perfect. Also, my advice would be to follow esports and stay up to date with any news.
What’s been one of the biggest surprises that you never thought of going into gaming?
One of the biggest surprises of gaming is the market is produced. Viewership numbers and revenue have surpassed billions of dollars!
