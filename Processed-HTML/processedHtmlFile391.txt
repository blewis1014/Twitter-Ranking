Three years ago, I found Bebe on the side of a road with her litter mates. She was estimated to be around 4-5 weeks old at the time. I brought her home, cleaned her up and she instantly became a part of our family.
On October 8th, Bebe was hit by a vehicle and has been in the animal hospital ever since. She suffered a huge diaphragmatic tear and was not in a stable enough condition to undergo surgery. Based on her injury, our vet believes she was ran completely over.
Dr Wills was very realistic with us and stressed that her hernia may not be fixable, and that if it was fixed there would be a long road to recovery. Bebe’s diaphragm was torn completely from her chest wall. Thankfully, he was able to repair it and she is finally progressing enough to come home. 
Any donations would help us tremendously!
