Helpful Search Tips
Allow for application-processing time – If you submitted your absentee ballot application within the last several business days, election officials may still be processing your request.  Until a request is processed, a record of your absentee ballot will not be available through  this service.
Match your name – Enter your first and last name exactly as they appeared on your voter registration or absentee ballot application.
Last name includes punctuation
If you have a hyphenated last name, such as Anderson-Smith, also try searching under Anderson Smith, Smith, or AndersonSmith.
If your name includes an apostrophe, such as O’Brien, also try searching under OBrien or O Brien.
Name has a suffix – If your name includes a suffix (Jr., Sr., III, etc.) do not include your suffix  in the Last Name field.
Match ID number
If you are not sure which ID number you used on your absentee ballot application, try separate searches for each ID type.
If you did not provide an ID number on your absentee ballot application, you cannot use this service to check the status  of your absentee ballot. Instead, please contact your county election office.
