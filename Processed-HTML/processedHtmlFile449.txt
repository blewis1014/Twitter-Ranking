Funerals & Memorials
On October 16, Sayed Reza Kohi was hit by an 18-wheeler and lost his life. A few years ago, Reza had brought his family to America.  On the way to work this morning, he left his two daughters and wife behind, not too far from his house. 
Reza Jan and his wife have no family here. His wife doesn’t have a job which puts the family in a critical situation. Any amount of donation will help the family towards the funeral expenses and give them stability for the wife and children's future.
We are deeply saddened by the lost of our loved one. Sayed Reza was an incredible husband, father, and friend. His presence always shined a light and we send our condolences to the Kohi family. May he rest in Jannah.
Please share this with anyone you can. If you are unable to donate, it would be highly appreciated to share this link and repost on your social media. Bringing awareness can have an impact.
