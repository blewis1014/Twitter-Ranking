The first few days of Animal Crossing: New Horizons are incredibly cruisy, with you having enough of almost everything you need, whether it be Nook Miles, Bells or materials to obtain items or build things naturally without having to grind too much.
This changes when you need to build Nooks Cranny and help out Timmy and Tommy Nook with some materials.
IN ORDER TO GET NOOK’S CRANNY, YOU NEED:
30 wood
30 hardwood
and 30 iron nuggets (bloody hell)
I was able to meet the three wood requirements almost instantly, but noticed an incredibly steep curve with the 30 iron nuggets. I thought I might be alone, but I quickly had friends asking me where to get iron nuggets. Similarly, heading onto Twitter resulted in a bunch of people commenting on the exact same issue.
HOW TO GET IRON NUGGETS
There’s a few ways to get iron nuggets, but it can still take a decent amount of time.
The number one way is to hit rocks with your shovel. If you put two holds behind you, you can hit it up to eight times and this will net you a random amount of iron nuggets
Rocks will regenerate after a day or two.
If you’ve eaten fruit, you will have super stamina which means that you’ll break the rock after one hit. To expel this stamina, you can dig up a tree and replant it or save your game, get out and head back into the game. You’ll still potentially get an iron nugget from breaking a rock, but you’ll only get one item.
Go to other friends islands or on a Nook Mystery Tour. Once you’ve broken all the rocks on your island, you’ll be out for a few days, so you can go to other friend’s islands and farm there (with their permission) or visit Nook Services and get a ticket to a Mystery Island (which will cost you $2,000 Nook Miles. Tom Nook will also give you one free ticket).
Chat to your Islanders. One of my Islanders chased after me and handed me five iron nuggets right off the bat.
Shoot down floating presents with your slingshot. You have a chance to also get five iron nuggets from shooting these down
