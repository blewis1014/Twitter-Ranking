Former Kansas City Chiefs running back Larry Johnson has had a wild post-NFL career on social media.
After the Lakers won the NBA championship on Sunday, Johnson shared his latest conspiracy theory stating LeBron James committed a “blood sacrifice” with Kobe Bryant to get himself another ring.
When a blood sacrifice pays off. Lol.

Oh. And it was game 6. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. “Sometimes we laugh, sometimes cry, but I guess you know now…”

Johnson also later try to tie in Barack Obama into the conspiracy theory when the former President congratulated LeBron for winning the championship.
Everyone will eventually have the veil removed from their eyes, exposing what this world really is…

When fans pushed back at his theory Johnson told them to unfollow him on Twitter.
STOP. FOLLOWING. ME. ON TWITTER.
This is not a popularity contest for me, nor do I tweet for relevancy.  I want nothing from this fallen world, but…
Distance & Irritation, until my Heavenly Father’s appointed time for me.

It’s clear that Johnson is off his rocker and needs to get help.
