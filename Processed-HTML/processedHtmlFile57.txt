Will Crash and Coco be able to save the world?
-All new-style gameplay action - scuba dive, ride a motorcycle, a baby T-Rex, and go free-roaming airborne in a plane!

The item was listed as 'very good' condition; I'd definitely have classed it as 'like new'! It's tough to find an old game without a few scratches but this one and the packaging was in perfect condition as though it had never been used! Very impressed!
