During this coronavirus outbreak, the one industry which is working day and night without even thinking about their lives and safety is healthcare industry. All healthcare establishments and personnel’s at all levels both in private as well as in public sector belonging to all systems of medicines are working day and night to help people from getting affected by this deadly disease coronavirus.
During this period, there is a possibility that people suffering from other medical ailments may not be able to get immediate and proper medical treatment.
Also, if the disease burden increases non-specialist may be required to treat respiratory illnesses and other ailments also.
Many patients may reach the hospitals late in view of this curfew and lockdown or may not be able to even reach any hospital or healthcare establishment.
Thus, this lockdown and curfew can lead to many medical complications which are caused not because of any healthcare negligence or fault.
So, it important for the central government to frame stringent orders and policies for healthcare establishment and personnel’s and to immediately implement the same saying that:
i.             Any action done by any healthcare establishment, doctors  and personnel shall not amount to medical negligence during this coronavirus period.
ii.           Doctors and other health care providers should be given food in the hotel and should not be allowed to be brought from home
iii.         Doctors have been covered free treatment if they get infected, same should be for their families if they get infected in turn.
iv.         Nurses and paramedical staff should be given limited/ restricted prescription powers, so that they don’t wait for the doctor for the prescription
v.           Telephonic and online consultation should be encouraged
vi.         Pharmacies should be allowed to dispense OTC drugs even without prescription
vii.       Doctors coming from other countries may be allowed to work under government supervision during this time without passing any exam if the shortage arises.
viii.      Final MBBS students may be utilised in the clinical work
ix.         Like in air lines, doctors working in COVID hospitals may be given a single room place a to stay on a near by hotel taken over by the administration. The family may like them to stay away during the time of crisis.
x.           OTC drugs should be allowed to be prescribed by all
xi.         Off label drugs should be encouraged and medical professionals should be allowed to write off label drugs
xii.       Central law should be passed for protection of healthcare establishment and health care personnel from violence and physical assault.
xiii.      Virtual Covid ICUs should be made with only 20-30-year-old young doctors and nurses managing them
xiv.      Senior doctors should manage only virtually
xv.        Infected people with mild illness and no oxygen dependence should not occupy any bed
xvi.      Elderly and high-risk people with mild infection should not be in any hospital environment
xvii.    Healthcare industry should be exempted from Consumer Protection Act.
xviii.  All dead bodies should be cremated with full respect and dignity
xix.      Compensation should be paid to the family of the deceased coronavirus patient pan India.
xx.        Healthcare establishment which are closed due to lockdown and curfew should be compensated
