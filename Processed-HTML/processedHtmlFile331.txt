VICTORY: Nordstrom Commits to Not Selling Fur and Exotic Animal Skins!

After decades of protests, petitions, and creative campaigning, we’re finally celebrating an announcement that Nordstrom will stop selling fur and exotic animal skins ! This change closes another major retailer’s doors to products that are a result of animal suffering, which will save countless animals and send the message that there’s nothing fashionable about animal cruelty.
Nordstrom is an American luxury retailer that opened its doors in 1901. It has long been the target of activists and animal protection advocates for supporting the brutal fur trade, and selling items made from the stolen skins of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and more.
Nordstrom was often one of the primary targets of  Fur Free Friday , an international day of action started by In Defense of Animals well over 30 years ago, the most widely attended annual demonstration in the history of the animal protection movement.  We also bought stock in order to attend Nordstrom shareholders meeting and crashed one of them with our fur-free message.
Now, however, we’re celebrating a big policy change of this retail giant! Nordstrom has officially announced that it will stop selling not only fur, but also exotic animal skins by the end of 2021. 
Of special significance is that Nordstrom is the first major retailer to go a step further than a commitment to go fur-free - it has also pledged to no longer sell exotic animal skins.
This new policy will be applied to Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack and Last Chance stores in the U.S. and Canada, in addition to its e-commerce sites, including Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom.ca, NordstromRack.com, Hautelook.com and TrunkClub.com.
Customers will no longer be able to find products made with fur from all types of animals including, but not limited to, mink, fox, lynx, chinchilla, rabbit, coyote, astrakhan/karakul lamb, kangaroo and raccoon dog or made with skin derived from any lizard, snake, python, alligator, crocodile, ostrich, shark, or stingray.
Nordstrom now joins a growing list of mega-retailers, like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, which also announced fur-free policies in 2019, the same year California became the first state in the nation to pass a statewide fur ban . Just this week, Israel became the first country in the world to ban the sale of fur for fashion. 
We thank all of our dedicated supporters who continue to sign our alerts, attend our Fur Free Friday events, and donate to stop the torture of innocent animals who are killed to make clothing and accessories. Together, we are making a huge difference and we truly appreciate your support!
