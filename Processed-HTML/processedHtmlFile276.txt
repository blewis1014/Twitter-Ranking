PITTSBURGH — Two Republican congressional candidates filed a lawsuit in federal court Friday asking for permission to have poll watchers at the satellite election sites in Allegheny County.
According to our partners at TribLive.com , the suit, filed by Sean Parnell and Luke Negron, argues that poll watchers are necessary at the locations to preserve the election’s integrity. The suit also references the issue reported earlier in the week in which nearly 29,000 voters received the wrong ballot after an error by the printing company.
Allegheny County approved a number of satellite election locations where voters could request, fill out and drop off a mail-in ballot in one stop. County leaders said the locations were opened as a result of the pandemic so voters could have a safe place to return ballots or apply for one.

The lawsuit says two men tried to get their poll watcher certificates for the satellite offices and were denied. The suit says the men were told by a county elections official that certificates were not available and had not yet been printed. The complaint says not allowing poll watchers at the location is a violation of the state Elections Code.
The suit asks the court to decide on the validity of ballots already cast at the locations, find that denying poll watchers is unconstitutional, and declare the rights of voters in Allegheny County have been violated.
It names the Allegheny County Board of Elections, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, County Councilwoman Bethany Hallam and County Councilman Sam DeMarco as defendants.
Sean Parnell is running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, and Luke Negron, running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills.
