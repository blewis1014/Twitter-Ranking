Editors’ Notes 2wice marks Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs’ first offering since being acquitted of sexual assault in 2016—a charge that could’ve landed him in jail for 10 years. The material here is accordingly reflective, tempering Gibbs’ street operas with musings on potential (“Crushed Glass”), parenting (“Homesick”), and growing up (“Alexys”). As always, Gibbs’ raps are low-key but expertly constructed, the work of a guy confident enough to know he doesn’t need to show off.
