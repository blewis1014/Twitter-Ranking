The NFL has no plans to move into a bubble as it takes several new steps to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The league will begin PCR testing for COVID-19 on game days starting this week, use of masks in walkthroughs are now mandatory and only play-callers will be permitted to wear face shields in lieu of masks or gaiters on the sideline.

COMWe cannot grow complacent, not the players, not the coaches, not the rest of our personnel, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Tuesday following virtual meetings with team owners. Ninety percent is not good enough in this environment. We have to be incredibly diligent and disciplined. The updated protocols sent to teams Monday night also require anyone identified as a high risk close contact to be isolated and not permitted to return to the teams facility for at least five days. We expected positive COVID cases as long as the pandemic is prevalent in our society, Goodell said, citing rising numbers in communities. Our protocols are designed to identify through testing, isolate and then prevent the spread of the virus in our team environments, and our medical experts are encouraged by the fact that with few exceptions, we have not seen transmission of the virus. Goodell spoke a few hours before the Tennessee Titans were scheduled to host Buffalo in their first game since an outbreak shut down team facilities and forced the schedule to be rearranged. The Titans had eight people test positive Sept. 29 and the total reached 24 players and personnel. It doesnt appear the league will discipline the Titans for any violation of protocols following a review of the teams actions. We are really working closely and identifying and speaking to clubs and players in open dialogue, Goodell said. This is not about discipline. This is about making sure were keeping our personnel safe. And thats been our entire focus
