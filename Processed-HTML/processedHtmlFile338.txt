Every person should feel represented when playing a game they love and making their avatar. Ethnic hair styles are often forgotten. In light of what is happening in America concerning black rights, it would be amazing to have gamers of all races represented on all gaming platforms. Let's start with Animal Crossing!
Let's create an environment of inclusivity and acceptance in this already amazing game.
