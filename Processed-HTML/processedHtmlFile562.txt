SANGER - Martavious Hill ran for 99 yards and three touchdowns to lead Aubrey over Sanger 48-25 Friday Night at Indian Stadium.
In a pivotal game in District 4-4A-II, Aubrey (7-1, 2-0) ran for 368 yards on 53 carries, averaging nearly seven yards per touch. Justin Gibby, JJ Cooke, and Braylon Colgrove combined for 195 yards and two touchdowns.
Two Sanger turnovers in the first half slowed an otherwise efficient offense. Aubrey capitalized on both turnovers to build an early 14-0 lead, with the second touchdown coming on a Wesley Huber 40-yard interception return.
