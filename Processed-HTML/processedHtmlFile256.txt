Minnesota GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan has accused Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison of abusing his power and threatened to file “a cease-and-desist order” against his office. 
On Tuesday night, Felton Farms in Northfield, Minnesota, held a private MAGA rally with Eric Trump, where congressional candidate Tyler Kistner and Carnahan also made appearances. Carnahan, who accused Ellison of “using his office to play politics” and “threatening” the farm venue, announced that the Republican Party of Minnesota would be filing a cease-and-desist order against Ellison’s office.
“Attorney General Keith Ellison is once again using his office to play politics. His team called and threatened a local family-owned farm for hosting a private MAGA event with Eric Trump this afternoon,” Carnahan said in a statement . “It is not required for citizens to file paperwork with the state of Minnesota for private gatherings.”
“Our goal in making inquiries like these, which we have been making of events for months, is to protect people’s lives: we do not try to stop events,” Attorney General Ellison told reporters in response. 
But Carnahan believes Ellison’s “abuse of power” is “infringing on the rights of our citizens.” 
“The Republican Party of Minnesota will make sure that Minnesotans are aware of elected officials abusing their power. We are filing a cease-and-desist order with the Attorney General’s office and we will continue to hold them accountable,” she said. 
The Minnesota DFL Party criticized the Trump family and Minnesota Republicans for the event.
“This colossal display of recklessness and stupidity is likely to accelerate the spread of COVID-19 in and around Northfield and land even more Minnesotans in the hospital,” the DFL said on Twitter . “The Trump family and Minnesota Republicans would gladly sacrifice your health to win a political campaign.”
Minnesota health officials have traced COVID-19 cases to events for both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, including four cases among anti-Trump protesters. 
Alpha News reached out to Attorney General Ellison’s office for comment on Carnahan’s accusations, but did not receive a response.
