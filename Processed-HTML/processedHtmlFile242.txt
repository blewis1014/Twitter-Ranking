Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., clawed back from an earlier assessment that Joe Biden has "good chance" of beating President Donald Trump, asserting Thursday night the incumbent would win.
In an interview on Fox News' "The Story," Graham changed his tune from what he told Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  earlier in the day.
"Now, y'all have a good chance of winning the White House; I don't know where the polls are going to be," Graham said at the committee's Supreme Court justice confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
But he told "The Story" host Martha McCallum: "I think President Trump is going to win."
He then ticked off all the reasons voters should be turned off by Democrats, including a push for "more justices to make [the Supreme Court]  liberal, to change the rules of the Senate, do away with Electoral College."
According to Graham, voters do not support that approach.
"That's why I think President Trump is going to win," he said. "I know that he's going to win in South Carolina. I know that's why I'm going to win.
"Is it close?" he continued. "Hell, yes, it's close."
