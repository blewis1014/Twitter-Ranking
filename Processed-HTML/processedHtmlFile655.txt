BTS‘s V, aka the artist Vante, has an eye for beauty and a talent for creating unique works of art.
Last January, V uploaded  photos of his art and art studio  to BTS’s fancafe. At the time, fans admired Vante’s breathtaking photography…

One of the paintings V shared shows a moonlit winter scene set against a blue, night sky.

ARMYs who tuned into TXT‘s broadcast today were delightfully surprised to see V’s painting displayed behind Yeonjun and Taehyun in Big Hit Entertainment‘s artist lounge.

First step lounge, next step exhibition? If V ever opens his Vante art gallery in the future, art lovers might be able to see this painting in person!
