Arendell Parrott Academy basketball is moving in a new direction for the 2020-21 season.
Clay Harrell was recently named the Patriots’ coach for the upcoming campaign. Harrell has been coaching as a varsity assistant for seven years — two at Wilson Beddingfield, two at Wilson Fike and three at APA — while also spending two years as the head basketball coach for the Patriots’ JV team.
“This means everything to me,” Harrell said. “I’ve worked for this position ever since I was a student assistant at Mount Olive, and I’m ready to help this team succeed.”
APA athletic director Matt Beaman said Harrell was the right guy for the job.
“He’s the hardest worker in the room and he’s built a great relationship with the guys,” Beaman said. “We know the team’s going to play hard and play the right way — they’ll give a lot of effort and I’m excited to see how they do.”
Harrell has some strong pieces to work with, as a backcourt of Nick Harrison and Mir Mir Moore will be the building blocks.
“We’re going to play a pretty exciting style, and it helps with the backcourt we’ve got,” Harrell said. “We want to get Nick and Mir Mir in space, as both have the ability to create and put the ball in the basket.”
