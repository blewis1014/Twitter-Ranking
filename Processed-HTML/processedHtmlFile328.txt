Dogs are very helpful to us, humans. They have millions of uses in our society: they support us emotionally, they guide us, they help sniff things out. Arguably, there are no substitutes for what they provide for us. But it turns out that dogs don’t see much difference between species, and they’re as good-willed and helpful to other species as they are to humans. Tao, the 12-year-old golden retriever who had his eyes surgically removed due to glaucoma, and Oko, his trusty helper, are a testament to that.
Melanie Jackson, the loving owner of Tao, recounted how it all went. Last year, Tao got diagnosed with glaucoma, an eye disease where the eye can’t effectively drain its fluids. The disease progressed unexpectedly and rapidly. One morning, Tao seemed to be doing just fine, but in the evening, he started shaking his head (dogs do that when they feel pain), and just a few hours later, he went blind in one eye and had the eye removed. In January, his other eye gave out and had to be removed as well.

Tao got diagnosed with glaucoma and lost both of his eyes. Despite his blindness, he recovered quickly and was happy again

But the dog recovered quickly. Just three days later, he was walking up the staircase all by himself and was able to walk off-leash. The dog seemed happy. But something was missing. Tao needed someone to play with him and keep him company, especially since he’d lost his sight.

“Tao’s health is really good now. He’s in no pain, and to say he’s nearly 12, he acts like a much younger dog! He does everything he used to do apart from jumping up hay bales and jumping over hedges—we walk around 8 miles a day and he still trains most days,” Melanie told Bored Panda.
The owner decided to look for a dog that could be a play pal for him
