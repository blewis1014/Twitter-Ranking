Fast Facts
The FDA is alerting pet owners and veterinary professionals about certain pet food products manufactured by Sunshine Mills under several brand names that may contain unsafe levels of aflatoxin. This is an expansion of a previously announced recall .
Aflatoxin is a toxin produced by the mold Aspergillus flavus, which can grow on corn and other grains used as ingredients in pet food. At high levels, aflatoxin can cause illness and death in pets.
Pets experiencing aflatoxin poisoning may have symptoms such as sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (yellowish tint to the eyes or gums due to liver damage), and/or diarrhea. In severe cases, this toxicity can be fatal. In some cases, pets may suffer liver damage but not show any symptoms.
Pet owners should stop feeding their pets the recalled products listed below and consult their veterinarian, especially if the pet is showing signs of illness.
The FDA is asking veterinarians who suspect aflatoxin poisoning in their patients to report the cases through the Safety Reporting Portal or by calling their local FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinators . Pet owners can also report suspected cases to the FDA.
What is the Problem?
On September 2, 2020, Sunshine Mills announced a recall of certain pet food products after a retail product sample was found by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture & Forestry to contain an unsafe level of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is a toxin produced by the mold Aspergillus flavus and at high levels it can cause illness and death in pets. The toxin can be present even if there is no visible mold.
On October 8, Sunshine Mills expanded its recall to include these additional products. FDA is issuing this advisory to ensure the public is notified about all of these potentially unsafe products that may still be on the market or in pet owners’ homes. 
FDA is conducting follow-up activities at the manufacturing facility.
This is a developing situation and the FDA will update this page with additional information as it becomes available.
What are the Symptoms of Aflatoxin Poisoning in Pets?
Pets are highly susceptible to aflatoxin poisoning because, unlike people, who eat a varied diet, pets generally eat the same food continuously over extended periods of time. If a pet’s food contains aflatoxin, the toxin could accumulate in the pet’s system as they continue to eat the same food. 
Pets with aflatoxin poisoning may experience symptoms such as sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (yellowish tint to the eyes, gums or skin due to liver damage), and/or diarrhea. In some cases, this toxicity can cause long-term liver issues and/or death. Some pets suffer liver damage without showing any symptoms. Pet owners whose pets have been eating the recalled products should contact their veterinarians, especially if they are showing signs of illness.
There is no evidence to suggest that pet owners who handle products containing aflatoxin are at risk of aflatoxin poisoning. However, pet owners should always wash their hands after handling pet food.
What Products are Involved?
On September 2, 2020, Sunshine Mills announced a recall of 12 total lots from six of the firm’s pet food products. Shortly after, FDA determined that additional products made with the same corn may contain unsafe levels of aflatoxin. On October 8, 2020, Sunshine Mills announced an expanded recall to include the additional products.  As new information becomes available, this list may continue to expand.
The list of recalled dry pet food products announced by Sunshine Mills on September 2 is:
Family Pet Meaty Cuts Beef, Chicken & Cheese Premium Dog Food 4 lb. UPC 3225120694
