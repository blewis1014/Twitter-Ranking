Wouldn't it be nice to see a brand-new Banjo-Kazooie game, or perhaps a new Conker?  With the relationship that Microsoft and Nintendo have, there'd at least be some chance those titles would see release on Nintendo hardware.  So what's stopping these games from happening?  According to a Kotaku interview with Xbox boss Phil Spencer, the decision to create those games is completely up to RARE.
"I leave it up to the studios in terms of the things that they want to go work on.  I have a lot of respect for Rare and the work that they do. They do like building new things, and they’ve seen success with Sea of Thieves. I think they’re really excited about Everwild. But also the response to Battletoads was nice. And I think [partner studio] Dlala did a good job with the game. And so I think it’s just always a balance. My inbox is full of: ‘Let every studio do new [intellectual property].’"
Obviously a new installment for these franchises isn't out of the question, but it doesn't seem like anything is going on right now.  Perhaps fans need to speak up a bit more and let RARE know they want to see their classic IP return!
