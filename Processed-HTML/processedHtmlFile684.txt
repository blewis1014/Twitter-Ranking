What to say, what to say, what to say?  I always come up short when it's time to talk about myself.  I'm a writer, but I don't really put it up anywhere.  I suppose I'm rather the insecure writer, given that I'll turn out a long story, but get so unsure about its reception that I'll either never put it up or I'll put it up for a brief moment and then take it down.  I consider myself a nice guy, relatively easy to approach, but quite hard to get through to.
