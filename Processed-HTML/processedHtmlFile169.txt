As of right now, it looks like the gang is back together! For the first time in two weeks, all of the former ‘Cats will be suiting up to play in the coming days. With no Thursday Nighter this week, every former Wildcat will play on Sunday, while Corey Peters travels down to Dallas in what should be an interesting game on Monday Night Football.
The marque matchup of the week is obviously in Tampa Bay; Aaron Rodgers vs Tom Brady as Za’Darius Smith and the Green Bay Packers look to remain undefeated against Mike Edward’s Buccaneers.
Looking over at the NFC, you see Steelers-Browns and usually shield your eyes, but this year it looks like this game has a lot of intrigue. The Browns are sitting at 4-1 with their first competent offense in 20 years, while the Steelers sit at 4-0 with the best defense in the league. This should create for an interesting matchup with Bud Dupree; can he keep his reign of dominance up against Cleveland?
We will also see if Josh Allen can return to the field in Week 6 after a knee injury that kept him out last week has him listed as day-to-day for Sunday.
Finally, we’ll see if Avery Williamson’s New York Jets cane finally get in the win column against a frisky Miami Dolphins team that looks like they’re including Lynn Bowden more in their offense as of late.
Check back on Tuesday (if COVID-19 doesn’t screw up the schedule again) for the review of Week 6.
