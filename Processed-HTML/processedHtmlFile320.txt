Ross Cayden started this petition to Primary Sponsor of 2019 Maryland House Bill 131 Delegate Karen Lewis Young
In honor of   Ross Cayden's Journey  we are seeking to establish a state and eventually a national registry where convicted animal abusers are listed in a legal and uniformed manner for agencies, rescues, shelters, breeders and other interested parties to reference before adopting out innocent animals to known and convicted animal abusers. A resource like this is imperative to the safety of our animals and the prevention of cruelty and heinous and senseless acts of torture to innocent animals.
