Therapy in the Great American West – August 11 2020
[Dialogue from a recent visit to my therapist]
HIM:  “Hey there, how’s it going?”
ME:  “Okay, I guess.”
HIM:  “Why, what’s going on?”
ME:  “Well, some people have thrown me under the bus at work.”
HIM:  “Hmmm…”
ME:  “And my secretary had a meltdown and quit.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And my dad died.”
HIM: “Oh, I’m sorry.”
ME: “And my wife is going to divorce me.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And I’ve developed quite a drinking problem.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And I think I’m going to have to put my dog down”
HIM: “OH SHIT!!! I”M SO SORRY MAN!!!”
Brother vs. Brother – August 7 2020
It sure is fun to think back to the good ole days (March 1 2020), when we used to muse over how absurd it was that brothers fought against each other in the civil war.
The Infinite Timeliness of Infinite Jest – August 6 2020
Thanks to the recommendation of Joshua Fields Millburn (of “The Minimalists”), who claims the book as his #1 favorite, I’ve undertaken the project of reading David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. I am in no way disappointed by the challenge, creativity, humor, magnitude, and overall ambition of the story. At just a little past halfway, several quotes have jumped out within the span of a (relatively) small number of pages… They stand out, both because they seem so applicable to the days we are living in, and because the book was published almost a quarter of a century ago:
Time in the shadow of the thing too big to see rising.
Sincerity with motive.
Regarding the truth as constructed rather than reported.
Outraged and Surprised (Not Surprised) – August 4 2020
The tinderbox of a country already ravaged by the emotional and physical duress of 2.5+ months of hysteria (and/or politically) induced lock-downs was ignited on Memorial Day by a police incident.
Since then, we’ve see murder, mayhem, rioting, burning, looting, dismantling, chaos…
We’ve seen campaigns against LEOs and our nation – blm, defund the police…
And the actual defunding and dismantling of police…
Thereby exposing the truly innocent to the violence incited by the “story”…
Real businesses ruined
Real communities ruined
Real lives ruined
Built on a narrative of a black man being “lynched” by a white man because of race…
But now, the complete video is out…
The officers were attempting to make a lawful arrest.
The suspect refused and resisted throughout…
It was clear he was under the influence of something (enough fentanyl to kill a horse)
The suspect said “I can’t breathe” many times BEFORE he was on the ground…
Respiratory distress is a common side effect of a fentanyl overdose
The suspect was trying to pass counterfeit money   The suspect resisted exiting his car
The suspect resisted handcuffs
The suspect resisted getting in the police car
The suspect was NOT innocent
There was reasonable suspension he committed a crime
He was high as a kite on a controlled substance
He resisted lawful arrest over and over
His respiratory struggles were very likely a result of his choice to use an illegal drug
The suspect was no angel
Perhaps, the office was no angel either.
But our entire country has been further torn apart
By the race baiting tactics of only sharing 15% of the story
The other 85% being admittedly held back by the MN AG who
Wanted a “successful prosecution” (of the cop)
[Some might call this “withholding exculpatory evidence”]
I call it negligent homicide (of our republic)
President Trump should send the bill for the damage done by COVID-19 to China (and Cuomo)
AND he should send the bill for all the costs of the “Floyd narrative”
to AG Ellison
SHAMEFUL!
Why is the Menu at the Speaker? – August 3 2020
As more and more of us spend more and more time getting meals from drive-through food establishments I’ve been reminded of three pet-peeves of mine that got under my skin LONG before the kung flu came alone…
If you don’t know the menu inside and out, and are ready to go with exactly what you want to order, park, get out and go inside.  (Or research the menu online before pulling up to the establishment.
If you’re ordering for like 10 different people (aka LDS families), park, get out and go inside.
WHY is the menu board at the speaker – or – why is the ONLY menu board at the speaker. Even for those of us who know the menu well, sometimes we like to check for new items, calorie counts, or seasonal specialties… It’s just so wasteful and stressful to spend so many minutes staring blankly ahead (listening to Patriot XM), while waiting in the line when we could be studying the menu – this would also help cut down on the time wasting of those who don’t follow Rule #1.
Were Double Agents “The Plan” all along? August – 2 2020
It’s seems like that for at least a couple of decades, the left has been subtly threatening our republic of a nearing date when the demographic make-up of our nation would become a majority-minority. Whether the implication of this change was to put white men on notice that their generations of systemic oppression would soon be over, or that the dems would thereafter have a permanent and veto-proof majority on government (our lives), or to somehow make us feel better about the destruction of our culture as the requirement of immigrants to enter legally, and assimilate quickly, has been strategically removed, or to reinforce the false mantra that “diversity is our strength”, or a combination of these or other ends is likely anybody’s guess.
Nonetheless, conservative patriots have for years been hand-wringing over the day when any sense of our once great republic would be completely gone.
The surprise is that most of us expected that this flip in demographics would be due to the flood of folks entering out country illegally ((D) pols for the votes, and (R) pols for the cheap labor – both sides turning a blind eye), and the subsequent extreme muddying of our cultural waters.
Who would have thought that the sum of all fears (or clear and present danger, if you prefer) would come from within – from our academic institutions that have been domestically indoctrinating generations of our children, using a combination of tactics, to increase their self-loathing and sexual-confusion; thereby, creating a hostile, angry, violent, confused, pathological mob-orgy of white, middle-class, America-hating marxists and anarchists hell-bent on destroying our nation like a angry child destroys her room?          Our biggest enemies have been hidden in plain sight all along.
Over the Hill Street Rhythm and Fake News Blues – August 1 2020
Last night my daughter and I participated in a “Back the Blue” rally sponsored by the local GOP affiliate. The format of the rally was to meet up in a field next to a burger stand, and near a bedroom community from our town, share community, form a “parade”, (which was more like a procession), of our vehicles and then drive up and down Main Street (following all local traffic laws). We do live in a western town, so the overwhelming majority of the vehicles were LARGE pick em up trucks. In fact, my mid-size SUV was one of the midget cars.
For a patriotic guy like me, it was so awesome to see almost 200 vehicles flying American, Thin Blue Line, Trump 2020, MAGA and even some Gadsden flags – most of the larger trucks had multiple oversized flags on poles mounted into the truck beds. Most vehicles also had “Back the Blue” and/or “DeFEND the Police” placards. Many had standard patriotic decorations and/or window chalk messages supporting LEOs, USA, and President Trump. The participants were of all ages, and included single dudes all the way up to large families, and was as ethically diverse as our community is right now.
The vibe among the rally, from the meet-up all the way through the actual parade, was positive, celebratory, community-building, and hopeful for our nation.
During the convoy from the neighboring town over the majority of folks we passed were honking and giving us thumbs upwardly pointing. There were folks who had actually sat out to watch us go by. Once we arrived on Main Street, (around 7pm), the encouraging shouts, honks and gestures continued. You could tell locals from tourists because most of the locals were smiling and cheering; whilst, the visitors just looked scared and a little confused.
Because downtown Main Street isn’t very long, our parade was shortly going in both directions as people turned around to come back through. I would say most people did at least 2 complete circuits – winding down around 8pm, although some continued to go back and forth until around 9pm. I don’t know if the police shut them down, or they just realized it was time, because we were home by 8pm.
There were some folks along the way, who made it a point to flip us the bird, and shout obscenities at us angrily. There were also a few small beat up Subarus that infiltrated our event with anti-LEO/blm/pride propaganda, profanity, and other miscellaneous obscenities on signs and/or window chalked on the bodies and windows. These cars were full of young, white, angry children yelling foul language and marxist/anti-American slogans at us. At one corner there were also around 30 kids of the same ilk with their placards, taunting, and lunging out at cars stopped at the light. Unfortunately for the kids on the corner, many of the bigger diesel pick-ups in our group hand to expel large quantities of horrible, black exhaust right as they passed by. Nonetheless, I would generally say that the event was hopeful for our nation. Yes, there are a small number of angry, indoctrinated, self-loathing, sexually-confused (most likely from their collegiate indoctrination), entitled, violent, white, middle class, children who were mimicking the nonsense they’ve been seeing out of Portland (et al) as they’ve been stuck at home, watching the “news” for 4+ months now, but our LARGE and community-representative, group, clearly still believes that America is Great!
So, the “fake news” – HUGE crowd of PRO-Americans from all across the community hold a positive event supporting our country, LEOs and president has a rally. There are a few, white, young, angry protestors. How did the local paper cover it?:
“‘Defend the Police’ demonstrators clash with counter protesters at car rally “ How were they “counter”-protesters? We weren’t protesting – we were rallying. I guess because in the new age, counter-protesting is the moral high ground?
Cars decorated with “Trump” and “Defend the Police” regalia filled Main Street in Bozeman Friday night, bringing traffic to a near standstill as a group of counter protesters with signs like “Blue lives don’t exist” chanted “You look stupid” at the entourage
People in cars shouted back, “Go back to Portland” and “USA.”
…organizer of the counter rally that included about 50 [exaggeration] people, said he’d been scrolling through social media when he came across a post about the car rally. After gathering feedback from other people, he decided to take action
many counter protesters, most of whom wore face masks, verbally confronted rally attendees from the sidewalk.
[“counter-organizer”] said he received threats through social media after organizing the counter rally. I call BS on that… They’re always victims. Not to mention it was the “counter” protestors (aka protestors), who were threatening, holding signs with profane and hateful messages, and shouting foul language (did I mention the rally included families with young children?), and none of that was mentioned in the article.
All in all, the article about a large, positive, rally supporting our community and country, clocked in at 593 words – of which 260 were about the folks angry and upset about the rally. So – 44% of an article about a large positive, community event, is given to the voices of a small negative minority? And yet, when this small minority had their “rally” several weeks back, there was much wider and deeper media coverage, and NO coverage of any differing opinions. The (intended?) effect – make the marxists seem like a significant percentage of the community when this is not in fact the case. #fakenews
systemic racism: – July 31 2020
The brothers and sisters who moved up to be a successful politician, preacher, professor/teacher, portrayer or player…
and then rather than hold themselves up as an example to encourage other young black men or women
recognize that with their status in our culture they have been moved into “the house”
and so to protect their status among their non-back peers in famous society
they foment and perpetuate the messages that hinder the hopes and dreams
of those very same people that might have, and some would say had duty to, inspired
@Barack, Cory, Maxine, Kamala, Al, Louis, Cornell, Toni, Oprah, Whoopi, Spike, Nick, Colin, Sir Charles, LeBron et al
AND yet, black Americans who dare share different perspectives or encourage “better choices” (e.g. education, parenting, diet, sobriety, employment, etc.) in their communities are oddly the ones chastised, vilified, called Uncle Tom, or House-N*, etc.
@Adams, Cosby, Crews, et al
Axl Was Right – July 30 2020
I moved to a small, white boy, town [sic] five years ago to escape the frantic and chaotic nature of the big city. I didn’t move there to be away from any race, culture, religion, creed, or belief system. I moved there to be in a town demonstrating traditional American values of civility on the streets, love of country, peaceful environment and respect for neighbors. And until May of this year, those were what I experienced. In the last 8 weeks or so, as the George Floyd death has been hijacked to promote angry, violent, dangerous, and marxist agendas, I’ve seen both a growth in racial diversity (a good thing), but with it a change in this small town that is not wanted here. Angry people threatening law enforcement, “change groups” bullying business into supporting the fake blm movement, the first time (3 times) I’ve heard a “boom” car going down a residential street after dinner time. So, as I reflect on THAT album, with THOSE songs, that came out THIRTY TWO years ago come this November, and recall how even then the language was very jarring (and controversial) which is why this high schooler at the time was drawn to it – I think about that language – what today we would, if directed at any non-protected class (e.g. white men) would categorize as a message of “social justice”, but when directed at anybody else, is tasteless at best, and provocative or hateful at worst, I nonetheless understand the anger it was communicating – the anger of the “other” (regardless of those other demographic categories) who comes into a community of established norms and then calls anybody “racist” or “_____phobic” who doesn’t like the imposition on their tranquility – especially where there are so many other communities where the offending behaviors are already well established as acceptable. Maybe I am “One in a Million”, but I maintain that Axl’s fundamental complaint is legitimate. Don’t bring “that” behavior to my little town.
The Button Man – July 29 2020
I met the most fascinating man at the local watering hole last night. He chose a stool catercorner to my corner seat, and ordered a Rainier draft. I was drinking Coors from a bottle. As we watched spectator-less baseball on the television over the bar he asked if I lived around here. I said I had for a few years and asked what he does for a living. Turns out, he’s the Button Calibration Man for Otis Elevator and Tapco Pedestrian Crossing Products. His is a demanding job that has him traveling all over the country, throughout the year, and working in all kinds of weather and other conditions. Turns out that federal statutes dictate that the buttons on these devices must be tested annually and recalibrated (when out of compliance) to the specifications for sensitivity and timing on these devices. Apparently there are very strict performance guidelines that insure that elevator cars come more quickly, and traffic lights change more quickly, depending on both the pressure and frequency with which the buttons are pushed by impatient users. Who knew?
The (blind) “KIDS” are NOT all right – July 23 2020
Today I listened in on a webinar of young, non-binary, POCs, Q-POCs et al re: challenges facing LGBTQ grade school students. The conversation of course included many “like”’s and “right?”’s… It included the new-fangled notion that all of us need to include our “preferred pronouns” when we introduce ourselves (to normalize the move away from the binary oppression of him/he/her/she etc…) But the highlight for me was when one panelist “educated” the listeners on an important new term – “adultism”
According to the panelist, this new term falls in the same family has racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, etc., etc., etc.,…
The panelist definition of “adultism” – “the systemic oppression of young people by older people who think that just because they’re older, have more experience, and typically have more education/knowledge, that they think they know more than young people…”
I guess the new “blind leading the blind” is “the youth leading the youth”…
Luckily, the first thing we can all do to end this horrible, systemic, misguided, (fictional) oppressive behavior,  assuming that older people “know more”, is to stop using the oppressive term “kids” when referring to “young people”…
22 a Day – July 22 2020
As a person who himself struggles with depression and other mental health issues, the number twenty-two is frequently on my mind – but especially so on this July twenty-second. 22 is the estimated number of veterans who take their own lives every day. That’s one suicide every 65 minutes.
Why did it pop out on my phone calendar this morning? Is it because it is the month of Independence Day, or because of the open and sanctioned hostility towards law enforcement and our nation, or because COVID-19 has so many of us shut in, by ourselves, struggling to manage our mental health – including widespread addiction issues that have spiraled out of control during the “lock downs”?
Probably all of the above.
Mental health. SUICIDES. Are likely high on the list of unreported collateral damage from this overreaction to the kung flu.
As a white, male, straight, job holding, law abiding, parent, and American loving patriot I’m so appreciative of the duty and sacrifice demonstrated by our military, law enforcement and first responders.
I’m also painfully aware of the betrayal and disrespect that the current state of our republic communicates to those of us who play by the rules and try to do the right thing by our fellow citizens – an impression that must be so incredibly multiplied for our soldiers, police, firefighters, EMTs, etc. A top five regret in my life is that I did not take the opportunity to serve in such a capacity when I was physically able.
22 a day. Signed up. Trained. Deployed. Faced death on our behalf. Come back to a country that is ambivalent and/or hostile to the values they sought to protect.
Are hammered with the angry voices of the entitled, ill-informed or simply indoctrinated against traditional American values.
Struggle with their mental health.
Ultimately take their life.
American Lives Matter
DFW – July 20 2020
Just finished Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace by David Lipsky. The quote that “vibrated on every frequency” for me was: “If I’m hanging out with you, I can’t even tell whether I like you or not, because I’m too worried about whether you like me”
Backward Compatibility – July 19 2020
Nobody much speaks about backward compatibility anymore.  This was an odd memory to run through the head almost two decades after the impending doom of Y2K.  Yet, that was the exact phrase that jumped into his head as he was walking moderately across the damp, stinky, swamp of fallen autumnal leaves blanketing the mid-Atlantic institution of higher learning, the site of so many memories he seemed to forever be struggling with.
He paused for a moment to lean down and tie an errant shoelace outside of the IT building that was the location of one particularly gruesome atrocity.  Perhaps that was the touchstone that had sparked this particular memory.  There was the duck pond over there just across the campus loop from his current location.  Despite being described on the walk and talk campus tours of prospective students as “where the ducks go”, the water was empty at present time.
All our fathers are dead now.  Our pimp hands are not only small, they have gone limp.  You know, it’s all a by-product of the multi-disciplinary, yet singularly focused “D School” mentality that has left our world savaged and overturned by the emotional agendas of a culture that’s decided it wants to be a woman – completely devoid of any remaining reason or accountability.  All these bad choices have pushed the few remaining good characteristics of our society into the corner of a badly painted, poorly lit and ugly room, only to be left cowering behind dusty, dirty chiffon curtains rippling lazily in a slight breeze of undetectable origin. 
Through this lens of possible pasts it is easy for one to get down about the harassment and damage down to our men by a world full of infinitely and righteously confident Frauen who have nothing but the worst of intentions for anything good that ever came out of this republic of ours.  In these, the “beast and the wurst” [sic] if times, it becomes very easy to reconcile oneself to the fact that if a heart is a snit then it just isn’t in it.  So says the nihilism that is always simmering inside and more and more frequently prarie-dogging to the service. 
All of which hearkens him back to the not so long ago days spent at the Greenwood Motel, sipping Mr. Pibb, and trying to stay upright on record tides, bearing swells of such intense urgency toward self-destructive thoughts, and the behaviors thereof that it’s hard not to lament them as dispatched to the annals of history…
Feeling good versus feeling lousy indeed, he often wonders if it is already too late to care.  If that is indeed the case, perhaps it is also the best form of freedom. Although certainly less fun, but more regulated than the comforts of chemical corruption that ruled life for two and half decades, at least he might begin to lay claim to but a sliver of the moral high ground after all.  Instead of an asterisk next to anything worthwhile he might do in the future, perhaps there should be one next to every part of her past? (!)
Either way, the final conclusion is likely the same – “does not support backward compatibility”.  Which should come as no surprise because the past always wins after all.
Confessions of an Outlaw – July 18 2020
In the last 21 months, Edward has host his father, God, wife, dogs, birds, and fun – but at least he’s discovered that his life is currently without meaning – hence the cognitive dissonance that has made him miserable for so many (all these) years. All that remains is doing everything he can to quell the marxist insurrection trying to overthrow the democratic republic which remains as the only thing to be loyal to. With these new revelations and understandings, Ed recognizes that all of the mementos, gadgets, photo albums, toys, tools, tchotchkes, memories and other sundry various stuff (shit), he has surrounded himself with are merely monuments, nay, headstones, the only purpose of which is to remind him of the things he’s squandered; thus, distracting him from the rebirth, the second chance, the opportunity to forgive himself, and move the fuck on. It’s time for him to stop wallowing in the past. Not forget. Remember the past, but long for the future. And so the sun rises on a new, clear skied, warm, sunny, beautiful day.
What does a successful “snark” look like? – July 14 2020

My Polling Data – July 13 2020
There seem to be many political polls being done. Recent history has exposed the unreliability of these measures. I find hope in my own polling techniques:
When driving around I look for the flags. If I see blm (marxist militia) or pride flags I count those as dnc households. If I see Old Glory flying I count those as RNC households. I tend to see the former category only in the epicenters of urban decay, and the latter just about everywhere else.
Another metric is stickers – bikes/scooters/skateboards/subarus with Gore/Lieberman, darwinfish, coexist, Hillary, change, feel the bern, sleepy joe, blah blah blah stickers – obviously dnc. American made automobiles with NO stickers = RNC.
(The sticker disparage is b/c we on the right respect differing (faulty) viewpoints; whereas, those on the left will do all sorts of horrible things to the stickers, your car, and your person, so savagely are they overwhelmed with derangement over not getting their way).
Based on these metrics, and the genius of the electoral college (which is the only thing saving our republic from marxist/socialist/communist rule of NYC and CA), I think we (conservative, republican, patriotic, Americans) will be successful in re-electing President Trump this November (God hep us if we don’t)…
But we can certainly not afford to be complacent either – the future of modern civilization is in the balance – in our hands.
We must be like Gwen Stefani and LEAVE NO DOUBT! come November 3 – which means every day between now and then requires our full and best efforts to make sure that we get FOUR MORE YEARS!
The 95% Quandary – July 11 2020
So you’ve been listening to a podcast for weeks, or reading a column, or watching a pundit, or taking a class, and 95% of whatever the “author” has been stating, even in cases of nuance, you are totally synced up with and then one day he/she says something that is so “you say up, and I say down” completely against your beliefs – what do you do? Not when it’s a seeming matter of opinion, but more like an absolute deal breaking position. Like if you’re Godly and the author shares that they’re atheist? Does the deal-breaker bring down everything else you agreed upon, or does it in fact, further fortify the things you do agree on? Does the ability to not agree 100% in fact add additional credibility to the 95% you do agree on? Do you delete the podcast, unsubscribe, stop watching, or drop the class, or do you rejoice in the beautiful freedom of recognizing that we do agree on more than we don’t and celebrate the freedom of independent thought absent of the knee-jerk impulse to CANCEL, CANCEL, CANCEL?!
The Unthinkable – July 10 2020
Pulling down statues, spray painting murals, and cancelling people will not change these facts:
White men birthed the greatest nation in human history on land liberated from red indigenous, hunter-gatherers and on the backs of black labor.
And now the blue people seek to capitalize on a intersection of national and global crises to overthrow the representative democracy of our republic and turn our nation red – communist red.
White men wrote the Declaration of Independence and Constitution – these two documents were the culmination of western thought, and the most profound expression of individual human rights in history – surpassed only by the New Testament. The authors understood that they weren’t perfect, that the documents weren’t perfect, and that no mortal man is perfect. But they were, and remain, the closest thing too perfect they could attain in the circumstances of the times during which they lived. These documents provided the mechanisms for the society they launched to continue working every day to improve on the union during every subsequent generation for the rest of history. A remarkable history that already includes a bloody and costly civil war, and multiple eras of civil rights movements to continue to march toward the ideals of equal rights for all. Out of the American citizenry, and thanks to the incentives for innovation at offer in a land of individual liberty driven by a free-market economy, the world was rescued from the nazis, the USSR, and got the internet, cell phones, the Panama Canal, nuclear power, automobiles, the assembly line, air travel, and man on the moon. It is in no way ironic to love this country and be proud of our history while also acknowledging the imperfections of our heroes. But to seek to cancel it is disgusting, traitorous, dangerous and unthinkable.
Three Choices – July 9 2020
So if I’m correctly interpreting the application of law & order in St. Louis, property owners have three choices when faced with the lawless thugs that have been allowed to take over our streets:
Forfeit their property to the mob
Exercise their 2nd Amendment rights by brandishing firearms to discourage the hoodlums from destroying property and then be prosecuted for felonious assault
Go down in a blaze of glory taking as many with them as possible
NMNM? – July 8 2020
Is a Mexican who has recently immigrated to the state of Mexico called a New Mexican New Mexican?
places – July 6 2020
Places where people used to gather, socialize and connect that have been lost to the modern conveniences of technology include: concerts (itunes), video stores (online porn), movie theaters (VOD), bars (plentitude of stores selling inexpensive spirits – the goal is the high not the social), libraries (amazon), grocery stores (peaPod)… It other words, technology has enabled us to be a species able to completely disconnect and live isolated, “satisfying” lives of “being entertained” without ever requiring the need to acquire basic skills of humanity, humility and civility.
How is it? – July 5 2020
That Twitter can edit me (by imposing an 11hour, and 59minute suspension for unstipulated grievances), and NOT be subject to slander law?
BTW – here is how 97% of the media cover domestic events in the US:
The “good” on the left is the exception to the rule – but is painted as the rule- 99 Mexican flags – LSM finds the one American flag
The “good” on the right is the rule – painted as the exception – 99 American flags – LSM finds the one Stars and Bars
IF you give JOE a Cookie THEN – July 2 2020
Joe Biden:.. it’s clear to me that, and I don’t know whether he did, he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff, gotten them all in one room and sat and said, okay. What are we doing to prevent this? What are we doing to prepare to deal with this, IF this is happening? How are we doing this? What are we doing?
Thirdly, he should, at a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, IF any of this is true and it doesn’t cease immediately, you’ve got a big problem, a big problem. And make it clear. Get to the bottom of this. It appears as though, from what I have… and I don’t have access to classified information anymore. But, IF what I have heard over the last week and the recent reporting that it was in the PDB, the presidential daily brief. The presidential daily brief is something I read every single day as vice president. The president read it every day. I was briefed every morning before I got to the White House, and then again. So, the idea that somehow he didn’t know or isn’t being briefed, it is a dereliction of duty, IF that’s the case. And, IF he was briefed and nothing was done about this, that’s a dereliction of duty.
I guess the best way for me to end this is, I was talking to Jill, my wife, Jill. And I don’t see her get outraged very often. But she started asking. She said, Joe, what would you have done IF Beau was still in harm’s way? And this information came out? And the president, Beau is my son who was… I’m sorry, I apologize, who served in Iraq for a year, was in the army. But, IF he’d been in Afghanistan, what would you do, Joe? What are those parents thinking out there? What are those sons and daughters, husbands and wives? It’s an absolute dereliction of duty IF any of this is even remotely true. So, I think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly, quickly.
Alex: What consequences should he face IF these allegations are true or these reports are true?
Joe Biden: IF these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this, THEN in fact, I think the public should, unrelated to my running, conclude that this man isn’t fit to be president of the United States of America.
IF you give a mouse a cookie,
He’s going to ask for a glass of milk.
When you give him the milk, he’ll probably ask you for a straw.
When he’s finished, he’ll ask for a napkin.
Then he will want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn’t have a milk mustache.
When he looks into the mirror, he might notice his hair needs a trim. So he will probably ask for a pair of nail scissors.
When he’s finished giving himself a trim, he’ll want a broom to sweep up. He’ll start sweeping. He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house. He may even end up washing the floors as well!
When he’s done, he’ll probably want to take a nap. You will have to fix a little box for him with a blanket and a pillow. He’ll crawl in, make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times.
He’ll probably ask you to read him a story. So you’ll read him one from one of your books, and he’ll ask to see the pictures. When he looks at the pictures, he’ll get so excited he’ll want to draw one of his own. He’ll ask for paper and crayons.
He’ll draw a picture. When the picture is finished, he’ll want to sign his name with a pen.
Then he’ll want to hang his picture on your refrigerator. Which means he will need…scotch tape.
He’ll hang up his drawing and stand back to look at it. Looking at the refrigerator will remind him that he’s thirsty so…he’ll ask for a glass of milk.
And chances are IF he asks for a glass of milk, he’s going to want a cookie to go with it.
At least live ASL is back – July 1 2020
As a kid I was always fascinated by the picture in picture oval of a live signer that accompanied some tv shows – usually religious in nature. In recent memory it seemed like that was a lost art, I suppose in thanks to the advanced technology of closed captions. So I have happily welcomed the return of the live signers who are an integral part of the COVID-19 updates being made by our supposed “leaders”. I am particularly impressed by the ability of signers for the leaders of our failing DNC controlled cities to so effectively emote the bleeding heart, reactive, weather vane like, mentalities of these mental midgets.
It’s a “lose-lose” for America – June 30 2020
In the U.S., our public schools, at best, do a mediocre job of teaching the basics. Almost all “outstanding” or even “good” students have outstanding parents and/or other supports – they are not a reflection of a great school or gifted educators. Our k-12 schools and almost all of our colleges and universities do a great job of teaching the victim/oppressor/marxist/socialist/equal outcomes/BLMLGBTQ agenda etc.
Our schools are failing, not as measured by the poor results many students earn on “high stakes” standardized tests, but in large part, because of those assessments. The preoccupation with these single snapshot measures creates a myopic focus on gaming that system and thereby hijacks the ability of educators to provide a comprehensive education of literacy, numeracy, arts, civics, and personal responsibility. Add to this the corrupting influence of our 100% leftist teachers unions and our children don’t have a chance. So most of our children leave school barely equipped to survive as functional adults, and with such a misguided indoctrination into the “free thinking” of the far left liberal mindset that for the American people it’s a lose-lose.
For this reason we need a new “Common Core” for the nation:
Personal responsibility
Therapy in the Great American West – August 11 2020
[Dialogue from a recent visit to my therapist]
HIM:  “Hey there, how’s it going?”
ME:  “Okay, I guess.”
HIM:  “Why, what’s going on?”
ME:  “Well, some people have thrown me under the bus at work.”
HIM:  “Hmmm…”
ME:  “And my secretary had a meltdown and quit.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And my dad died.”
HIM: “Oh, I’m sorry.”
ME: “And my wife is going to divorce me.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And I’ve developed quite a drinking problem.”
HIM: “Hmmm…”
ME: “And I think I’m going to have to put my dog down”
HIM: “OH SHIT!!! I”M SO SORRY MAN!!!”
Brother vs. Brother – August 7 2020
It sure is fun to think back to the good ole days (March 1 2020), when we used to muse over how absurd it was that brothers fought against each other in the civil war.
The Infinite Timeliness of Infinite Jest – August 6 2020
Thanks to the recommendation of Joshua Fields Millburn (of “The Minimalists”), who claims the book as his #1 favorite, I’ve undertaken the project of reading David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. I am in no way disappointed by the challenge, creativity, humor, magnitude, and overall ambition of the story. At just a little past halfway, several quotes have jumped out within the span of a (relatively) small number of pages… They stand out, both because they seem so applicable to the days we are living in, and because the book was published almost a quarter of a century ago:
Time in the shadow of the thing too big to see rising.
Sincerity with motive.
Regarding the truth as constructed rather than reported.
Outraged and Surprised (Not Surprised) – August 4 2020
The tinderbox of a country already ravaged by the emotional and physical duress of 2.5+ months of hysteria (and/or politically) induced lock-downs was ignited on Memorial Day by a police incident.
Since then, we’ve see murder, mayhem, rioting, burning, looting, dismantling, chaos…
We’ve seen campaigns against LEOs and our nation – blm, defund the police…
And the actual defunding and dismantling of police…
Thereby exposing the truly innocent to the violence incited by the “story”…
Real businesses ruined
Real communities ruined
Real lives ruined
Built on a narrative of a black man being “lynched” by a white man because of race…
But now, the complete video is out…
The officers were attempting to make a lawful arrest.
The suspect refused and resisted throughout…
It was clear he was under the influence of something (enough fentanyl to kill a horse)
The suspect said “I can’t breathe” many times BEFORE he was on the ground…
Respiratory distress is a common side effect of a fentanyl overdose
The suspect was trying to pass counterfeit money   The suspect resisted exiting his car
The suspect resisted handcuffs
The suspect resisted getting in the police car
The suspect was NOT innocent
There was reasonable suspension he committed a crime
He was high as a kite on a controlled substance
He resisted lawful arrest over and over
His respiratory struggles were very likely a result of his choice to use an illegal drug
The suspect was no angel
Perhaps, the office was no angel either.
But our entire country has been further torn apart
By the race baiting tactics of only sharing 15% of the story
The other 85% being admittedly held back by the MN AG who
Wanted a “successful prosecution” (of the cop)
[Some might call this “withholding exculpatory evidence”]
I call it negligent homicide (of our republic)
President Trump should send the bill for the damage done by COVID-19 to China (and Cuomo)
AND he should send the bill for all the costs of the “Floyd narrative”
to AG Ellison
SHAMEFUL!
Why is the Menu at the Speaker? – August 3 2020
As more and more of us spend more and more time getting meals from drive-through food establishments I’ve been reminded of three pet-peeves of mine that got under my skin LONG before the kung flu came alone…
If you don’t know the menu inside and out, and are ready to go with exactly what you want to order, park, get out and go inside.  (Or research the menu online before pulling up to the establishment.
If you’re ordering for like 10 different people (aka LDS families), park, get out and go inside.
WHY is the menu board at the speaker – or – why is the ONLY menu board at the speaker. Even for those of us who know the menu well, sometimes we like to check for new items, calorie counts, or seasonal specialties… It’s just so wasteful and stressful to spend so many minutes staring blankly ahead (listening to Patriot XM), while waiting in the line when we could be studying the menu – this would also help cut down on the time wasting of those who don’t follow Rule #1.
Were Double Agents “The Plan” all along? August – 2 2020
It’s seems like that for at least a couple of decades, the left has been subtly threatening our republic of a nearing date when the demographic make-up of our nation would become a majority-minority. Whether the implication of this change was to put white men on notice that their generations of systemic oppression would soon be over, or that the dems would thereafter have a permanent and veto-proof majority on government (our lives), or to somehow make us feel better about the destruction of our culture as the requirement of immigrants to enter legally, and assimilate quickly, has been strategically removed, or to reinforce the false mantra that “diversity is our strength”, or a combination of these or other ends is likely anybody’s guess.
Nonetheless, conservative patriots have for years been hand-wringing over the day when any sense of our once great republic would be completely gone.
The surprise is that most of us expected that this flip in demographics would be due to the flood of folks entering out country illegally ((D) pols for the votes, and (R) pols for the cheap labor – both sides turning a blind eye), and the subsequent extreme muddying of our cultural waters.
Who would have thought that the sum of all fears (or clear and present danger, if you prefer) would come from within – from our academic institutions that have been domestically indoctrinating generations of our children, using a combination of tactics, to increase their self-loathing and sexual-confusion; thereby, creating a hostile, angry, violent, confused, pathological mob-orgy of white, middle-class, America-hating marxists and anarchists hell-bent on destroying our nation like a angry child destroys her room?          Our biggest enemies have been hidden in plain sight all along.
Over the Hill Street Rhythm and Fake News Blues – August 1 2020
Last night my daughter and I participated in a “Back the Blue” rally sponsored by the local GOP affiliate. The format of the rally was to meet up in a field next to a burger stand, and near a bedroom community from our town, share community, form a “parade”, (which was more like a procession), of our vehicles and then drive up and down Main Street (following all local traffic laws). We do live in a western town, so the overwhelming majority of the vehicles were LARGE pick em up trucks. In fact, my mid-size SUV was one of the midget cars.
For a patriotic guy like me, it was so awesome to see almost 200 vehicles flying American, Thin Blue Line, Trump 2020, MAGA and even some Gadsden flags – most of the larger trucks had multiple oversized flags on poles mounted into the truck beds. Most vehicles also had “Back the Blue” and/or “DeFEND the Police” placards. Many had standard patriotic decorations and/or window chalk messages supporting LEOs, USA, and President Trump. The participants were of all ages, and included single dudes all the way up to large families, and was as ethically diverse as our community is right now.
The vibe among the rally, from the meet-up all the way through the actual parade, was positive, celebratory, community-building, and hopeful for our nation.
During the convoy from the neighboring town over the majority of folks we passed were honking and giving us thumbs upwardly pointing. There were folks who had actually sat out to watch us go by. Once we arrived on Main Street, (around 7pm), the encouraging shouts, honks and gestures continued. You could tell locals from tourists because most of the locals were smiling and cheering; whilst, the visitors just looked scared and a little confused.
Because downtown Main Street isn’t very long, our parade was shortly going in both directions as people turned around to come back through. I would say most people did at least 2 complete circuits – winding down around 8pm, although some continued to go back and forth until around 9pm. I don’t know if the police shut them down, or they just realized it was time, because we were home by 8pm.
There were some folks along the way, who made it a point to flip us the bird, and shout obscenities at us angrily. There were also a few small beat up Subarus that infiltrated our event with anti-LEO/blm/pride propaganda, profanity, and other miscellaneous obscenities on signs and/or window chalked on the bodies and windows. These cars were full of young, white, angry children yelling foul language and marxist/anti-American slogans at us. At one corner there were also around 30 kids of the same ilk with their placards, taunting, and lunging out at cars stopped at the light. Unfortunately for the kids on the corner, many of the bigger diesel pick-ups in our group hand to expel large quantities of horrible, black exhaust right as they passed by. Nonetheless, I would generally say that the event was hopeful for our nation. Yes, there are a small number of angry, indoctrinated, self-loathing, sexually-confused (most likely from their collegiate indoctrination), entitled, violent, white, middle class, children who were mimicking the nonsense they’ve been seeing out of Portland (et al) as they’ve been stuck at home, watching the “news” for 4+ months now, but our LARGE and community-representative, group, clearly still believes that America is Great!
So, the “fake news” – HUGE crowd of PRO-Americans from all across the community hold a positive event supporting our country, LEOs and president has a rally. There are a few, white, young, angry protestors. How did the local paper cover it?:
“‘Defend the Police’ demonstrators clash with counter protesters at car rally “ How were they “counter”-protesters? We weren’t protesting – we were rallying. I guess because in the new age, counter-protesting is the moral high ground?
Cars decorated with “Trump” and “Defend the Police” regalia filled Main Street in Bozeman Friday night, bringing traffic to a near standstill as a group of counter protesters with signs like “Blue lives don’t exist” chanted “You look stupid” at the entourage
People in cars shouted back, “Go back to Portland” and “USA.”
…organizer of the counter rally that included about 50 [exaggeration] people, said he’d been scrolling through social media when he came across a post about the car rally. After gathering feedback from other people, he decided to take action
many counter protesters, most of whom wore face masks, verbally confronted rally attendees from the sidewalk.
[“counter-organizer”] said he received threats through social media after organizing the counter rally. I call BS on that… They’re always victims. Not to mention it was the “counter” protestors (aka protestors), who were threatening, holding signs with profane and hateful messages, and shouting foul language (did I mention the rally included families with young children?), and none of that was mentioned in the article.
All in all, the article about a large, positive, rally supporting our community and country, clocked in at 593 words – of which 260 were about the folks angry and upset about the rally. So – 44% of an article about a large positive, community event, is given to the voices of a small negative minority? And yet, when this small minority had their “rally” several weeks back, there was much wider and deeper media coverage, and NO coverage of any differing opinions. The (intended?) effect – make the marxists seem like a significant percentage of the community when this is not in fact the case. #fakenews
systemic racism: – July 31 2020
The brothers and sisters who moved up to be a successful politician, preacher, professor/teacher, portrayer or player…
and then rather than hold themselves up as an example to encourage other young black men or women
recognize that with their status in our culture they have been moved into “the house”
and so to protect their status among their non-back peers in famous society
they foment and perpetuate the messages that hinder the hopes and dreams
of those very same people that might have, and some would say had duty to, inspired
@Barack, Cory, Maxine, Kamala, Al, Louis, Cornell, Toni, Oprah, Whoopi, Spike, Nick, Colin, Sir Charles, LeBron et al
AND yet, black Americans who dare share different perspectives or encourage “better choices” (e.g. education, parenting, diet, sobriety, employment, etc.) in their communities are oddly the ones chastised, vilified, called Uncle Tom, or House-N*, etc.
@Adams, Cosby, Crews, et al
Axl Was Right – July 30 2020
I moved to a small, white boy, town [sic] five years ago to escape the frantic and chaotic nature of the big city. I didn’t move there to be away from any race, culture, religion, creed, or belief system. I moved there to be in a town demonstrating traditional American values of civility on the streets, love of country, peaceful environment and respect for neighbors. And until May of this year, those were what I experienced. In the last 8 weeks or so, as the George Floyd death has been hijacked to promote angry, violent, dangerous, and marxist agendas, I’ve seen both a growth in racial diversity (a good thing), but with it a change in this small town that is not wanted here. Angry people threatening law enforcement, “change groups” bullying business into supporting the fake blm movement, the first time (3 times) I’ve heard a “boom” car going down a residential street after dinner time. So, as I reflect on THAT album, with THOSE songs, that came out THIRTY TWO years ago come this November, and recall how even then the language was very jarring (and controversial) which is why this high schooler at the time was drawn to it – I think about that language – what today we would, if directed at any non-protected class (e.g. white men) would categorize as a message of “social justice”, but when directed at anybody else, is tasteless at best, and provocative or hateful at worst, I nonetheless understand the anger it was communicating – the anger of the “other” (regardless of those other demographic categories) who comes into a community of established norms and then calls anybody “racist” or “_____phobic” who doesn’t like the imposition on their tranquility – especially where there are so many other communities where the offending behaviors are already well established as acceptable. Maybe I am “One in a Million”, but I maintain that Axl’s fundamental complaint is legitimate. Don’t bring “that” behavior to my little town.
The Button Man – July 29 2020
I met the most fascinating man at the local watering hole last night. He chose a stool catercorner to my corner seat, and ordered a Rainier draft. I was drinking Coors from a bottle. As we watched spectator-less baseball on the television over the bar he asked if I lived around here. I said I had for a few years and asked what he does for a living. Turns out, he’s the Button Calibration Man for Otis Elevator and Tapco Pedestrian Crossing Products. His is a demanding job that has him traveling all over the country, throughout the year, and working in all kinds of weather and other conditions. Turns out that federal statutes dictate that the buttons on these devices must be tested annually and recalibrated (when out of compliance) to the specifications for sensitivity and timing on these devices. Apparently there are very strict performance guidelines that insure that elevator cars come more quickly, and traffic lights change more quickly, depending on both the pressure and frequency with which the buttons are pushed by impatient users. Who knew?
The (blind) “KIDS” are NOT all right – July 23 2020
Today I listened in on a webinar of young, non-binary, POCs, Q-POCs et al re: challenges facing LGBTQ grade school students. The conversation of course included many “like”’s and “right?”’s… It included the new-fangled notion that all of us need to include our “preferred pronouns” when we introduce ourselves (to normalize the move away from the binary oppression of him/he/her/she etc…) But the highlight for me was when one panelist “educated” the listeners on an important new term – “adultism”
According to the panelist, this new term falls in the same family has racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, etc., etc., etc.,…
The panelist definition of “adultism” – “the systemic oppression of young people by older people who think that just because they’re older, have more experience, and typically have more education/knowledge, that they think they know more than young people…”
I guess the new “blind leading the blind” is “the youth leading the youth”…
Luckily, the first thing we can all do to end this horrible, systemic, misguided, (fictional) oppressive behavior,  assuming that older people “know more”, is to stop using the oppressive term “kids” when referring to “young people”…
22 a Day – July 22 2020
As a person who himself struggles with depression and other mental health issues, the number twenty-two is frequently on my mind – but especially so on this July twenty-second. 22 is the estimated number of veterans who take their own lives every day. That’s one suicide every 65 minutes.
Why did it pop out on my phone calendar this morning? Is it because it is the month of Independence Day, or because of the open and sanctioned hostility towards law enforcement and our nation, or because COVID-19 has so many of us shut in, by ourselves, struggling to manage our mental health – including widespread addiction issues that have spiraled out of control during the “lock downs”?
Probably all of the above.
Mental health. SUICIDES. Are likely high on the list of unreported collateral damage from this overreaction to the kung flu.
As a white, male, straight, job holding, law abiding, parent, and American loving patriot I’m so appreciative of the duty and sacrifice demonstrated by our military, law enforcement and first responders.
I’m also painfully aware of the betrayal and disrespect that the current state of our republic communicates to those of us who play by the rules and try to do the right thing by our fellow citizens – an impression that must be so incredibly multiplied for our soldiers, police, firefighters, EMTs, etc. A top five regret in my life is that I did not take the opportunity to serve in such a capacity when I was physically able.
22 a day. Signed up. Trained. Deployed. Faced death on our behalf. Come back to a country that is ambivalent and/or hostile to the values they sought to protect.
Are hammered with the angry voices of the entitled, ill-informed or simply indoctrinated against traditional American values.
Struggle with their mental health.
Ultimately take their life.

DFW – July 20 2020
Just finished Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace by David Lipsky. The quote that “vibrated on every frequency” for me was: “If I’m hanging out with you, I can’t even tell whether I like you or not, because I’m too worried about whether you like me”
Backward Compatibility – July 19 2020
Nobody much speaks about backward compatibility anymore.  This was an odd memory to run through the head almost two decades after the impending doom of Y2K.  Yet, that was the exact phrase that jumped into his head as he was walking moderately across the damp, stinky, swamp of fallen autumnal leaves blanketing the mid-Atlantic institution of higher learning, the site of so many memories he seemed to forever be struggling with.
He paused for a moment to lean down and tie an errant shoelace outside of the IT building that was the location of one particularly gruesome atrocity.  Perhaps that was the touchstone that had sparked this particular memory.  There was the duck pond over there just across the campus loop from his current location.  Despite being described on the walk and talk campus tours of prospective students as “where the ducks go”, the water was empty at present time.
All our fathers are dead now.  Our pimp hands are not only small, they have gone limp.  You know, it’s all a by-product of the multi-disciplinary, yet singularly focused “D School” mentality that has left our world savaged and overturned by the emotional agendas of a culture that’s decided it wants to be a woman – completely devoid of any remaining reason or accountability.  All these bad choices have pushed the few remaining good characteristics of our society into the corner of a badly painted, poorly lit and ugly room, only to be left cowering behind dusty, dirty chiffon curtains rippling lazily in a slight breeze of undetectable origin. 
Through this lens of possible pasts it is easy for one to get down about the harassment and damage down to our men by a world full of infinitely and righteously confident Frauen who have nothing but the worst of intentions for anything good that ever came out of this republic of ours.  In these, the “beast and the wurst” [sic] if times, it becomes very easy to reconcile oneself to the fact that if a heart is a snit then it just isn’t in it.  So says the nihilism that is always simmering inside and more and more frequently prarie-dogging to the service. 
All of which hearkens him back to the not so long ago days spent at the Greenwood Motel, sipping Mr. Pibb, and trying to stay upright on record tides, bearing swells of such intense urgency toward self-destructive thoughts, and the behaviors thereof that it’s hard not to lament them as dispatched to the annals of history…
Feeling good versus feeling lousy indeed, he often wonders if it is already too late to care.  If that is indeed the case, perhaps it is also the best form of freedom. Although certainly less fun, but more regulated than the comforts of chemical corruption that ruled life for two and half decades, at least he might begin to lay claim to but a sliver of the moral high ground after all.  Instead of an asterisk next to anything worthwhile he might do in the future, perhaps there should be one next to every part of her past? (!)
Either way, the final conclusion is likely the same – “does not support backward compatibility”.  Which should come as no surprise because the past always wins after all.
Confessions of an Outlaw – July 18 2020
In the last 21 months, Edward has host his father, God, wife, dogs, birds, and fun – but at least he’s discovered that his life is currently without meaning – hence the cognitive dissonance that has made him miserable for so many (all these) years. All that remains is doing everything he can to quell the marxist insurrection trying to overthrow the democratic republic which remains as the only thing to be loyal to. With these new revelations and understandings, Ed recognizes that all of the mementos, gadgets, photo albums, toys, tools, tchotchkes, memories and other sundry various stuff (shit), he has surrounded himself with are merely monuments, nay, headstones, the only purpose of which is to remind him of the things he’s squandered; thus, distracting him from the rebirth, the second chance, the opportunity to forgive himself, and move the fuck on. It’s time for him to stop wallowing in the past. Not forget. Remember the past, but long for the future. And so the sun rises on a new, clear skied, warm, sunny, beautiful day.
What does a successful “snark” look like? – July 14 2020

My Polling Data – July 13 2020
There seem to be many political polls being done. Recent history has exposed the unreliability of these measures. I find hope in my own polling techniques:
When driving around I look for the flags. If I see blm (marxist militia) or pride flags I count those as dnc households. If I see Old Glory flying I count those as RNC households. I tend to see the former category only in the epicenters of urban decay, and the latter just about everywhere else.
Another metric is stickers – bikes/scooters/skateboards/subarus with Gore/Lieberman, darwinfish, coexist, Hillary, change, feel the bern, sleepy joe, blah blah blah stickers – obviously dnc. American made automobiles with NO stickers = RNC.
(The sticker disparage is b/c we on the right respect differing (faulty) viewpoints; whereas, those on the left will do all sorts of horrible things to the stickers, your car, and your person, so savagely are they overwhelmed with derangement over not getting their way).
Based on these metrics, and the genius of the electoral college (which is the only thing saving our republic from marxist/socialist/communist rule of NYC and CA), I think we (conservative, republican, patriotic, Americans) will be successful in re-electing President Trump this November (God hep us if we don’t)…
But we can certainly not afford to be complacent either – the future of modern civilization is in the balance – in our hands.
We must be like Gwen Stefani and LEAVE NO DOUBT! come November 3 – which means every day between now and then requires our full and best efforts to make sure that we get FOUR MORE YEARS!
The 95% Quandary – July 11 2020
So you’ve been listening to a podcast for weeks, or reading a column, or watching a pundit, or taking a class, and 95% of whatever the “author” has been stating, even in cases of nuance, you are totally synced up with and then one day he/she says something that is so “you say up, and I say down” completely against your beliefs – what do you do? Not when it’s a seeming matter of opinion, but more like an absolute deal breaking position. Like if you’re Godly and the author shares that they’re atheist? Does the deal-breaker bring down everything else you agreed upon, or does it in fact, further fortify the things you do agree on? Does the ability to not agree 100% in fact add additional credibility to the 95% you do agree on? Do you delete the podcast, unsubscribe, stop watching, or drop the class, or do you rejoice in the beautiful freedom of recognizing that we do agree on more than we don’t and celebrate the freedom of independent thought absent of the knee-jerk impulse to CANCEL, CANCEL, CANCEL?!
The Unthinkable – July 10 2020
Pulling down statues, spray painting murals, and cancelling people will not change these facts:
White men birthed the greatest nation in human history on land liberated from red indigenous, hunter-gatherers and on the backs of black labor.
And now the blue people seek to capitalize on a intersection of national and global crises to overthrow the representative democracy of our republic and turn our nation red – communist red.
White men wrote the Declaration of Independence and Constitution – these two documents were the culmination of western thought, and the most profound expression of individual human rights in history – surpassed only by the New Testament. The authors understood that they weren’t perfect, that the documents weren’t perfect, and that no mortal man is perfect. But they were, and remain, the closest thing too perfect they could attain in the circumstances of the times during which they lived. These documents provided the mechanisms for the society they launched to continue working every day to improve on the union during every subsequent generation for the rest of history. A remarkable history that already includes a bloody and costly civil war, and multiple eras of civil rights movements to continue to march toward the ideals of equal rights for all. Out of the American citizenry, and thanks to the incentives for innovation at offer in a land of individual liberty driven by a free-market economy, the world was rescued from the nazis, the USSR, and got the internet, cell phones, the Panama Canal, nuclear power, automobiles, the assembly line, air travel, and man on the moon. It is in no way ironic to love this country and be proud of our history while also acknowledging the imperfections of our heroes. But to seek to cancel it is disgusting, traitorous, dangerous and unthinkable.
Three Choices – July 9 2020
So if I’m correctly interpreting the application of law & order in St. Louis, property owners have three choices when faced with the lawless thugs that have been allowed to take over our streets:
Forfeit their property to the mob
Exercise their 2nd Amendment rights by brandishing firearms to discourage the hoodlums from destroying property and then be prosecuted for felonious assault
Go down in a blaze of glory taking as many with them as possible
NMNM? – July 8 2020
Is a Mexican who has recently immigrated to the state of Mexico called a New Mexican New Mexican?
places – July 6 2020
Places where people used to gather, socialize and connect that have been lost to the modern conveniences of technology include: concerts (itunes), video stores (online porn), movie theaters (VOD), bars (plentitude of stores selling inexpensive spirits – the goal is the high not the social), libraries (amazon), grocery stores (peaPod)… It other words, technology has enabled us to be a species able to completely disconnect and live isolated, “satisfying” lives of “being entertained” without ever requiring the need to acquire basic skills of humanity, humility and civility.
How is it? – July 5 2020
That Twitter can edit me (by imposing an 11hour, and 59minute suspension for unstipulated grievances), and NOT be subject to slander law?
BTW – here is how 97% of the media cover domestic events in the US:
The “good” on the left is the exception to the rule – but is painted as the rule- 99 Mexican flags – LSM finds the one American flag
The “good” on the right is the rule – painted as the exception – 99 American flags – LSM finds the one Stars and Bars
IF you give JOE a Cookie THEN – July 2 2020
Joe Biden:.. it’s clear to me that, and I don’t know whether he did, he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff, gotten them all in one room and sat and said, okay. What are we doing to prevent this? What are we doing to prepare to deal with this, IF this is happening? How are we doing this? What are we doing?
Thirdly, he should, at a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, IF any of this is true and it doesn’t cease immediately, you’ve got a big problem, a big problem. And make it clear. Get to the bottom of this. It appears as though, from what I have… and I don’t have access to classified information anymore. But, IF what I have heard over the last week and the recent reporting that it was in the PDB, the presidential daily brief. The presidential daily brief is something I read every single day as vice president. The president read it every day. I was briefed every morning before I got to the White House, and then again. So, the idea that somehow he didn’t know or isn’t being briefed, it is a dereliction of duty, IF that’s the case. And, IF he was briefed and nothing was done about this, that’s a dereliction of duty.
I guess the best way for me to end this is, I was talking to Jill, my wife, Jill. And I don’t see her get outraged very often. But she started asking. She said, Joe, what would you have done IF Beau was still in harm’s way? And this information came out? And the president, Beau is my son who was… I’m sorry, I apologize, who served in Iraq for a year, was in the army. But, IF he’d been in Afghanistan, what would you do, Joe? What are those parents thinking out there? What are those sons and daughters, husbands and wives? It’s an absolute dereliction of duty IF any of this is even remotely true. So, I think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly, quickly.
Alex: What consequences should he face IF these allegations are true or these reports are true?
Joe Biden: IF these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this, THEN in fact, I think the public should, unrelated to my running, conclude that this man isn’t fit to be president of the United States of America.
IF you give a mouse a cookie,
He’s going to ask for a glass of milk.
When you give him the milk, he’ll probably ask you for a straw.
When he’s finished, he’ll ask for a napkin.
Then he will want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn’t have a milk mustache.
When he looks into the mirror, he might notice his hair needs a trim. So he will probably ask for a pair of nail scissors.
When he’s finished giving himself a trim, he’ll want a broom to sweep up. He’ll start sweeping. He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house. He may even end up washing the floors as well!
When he’s done, he’ll probably want to take a nap. You will have to fix a little box for him with a blanket and a pillow. He’ll crawl in, make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times.
He’ll probably ask you to read him a story. So you’ll read him one from one of your books, and he’ll ask to see the pictures. When he looks at the pictures, he’ll get so excited he’ll want to draw one of his own. He’ll ask for paper and crayons.
He’ll draw a picture. When the picture is finished, he’ll want to sign his name with a pen.
Then he’ll want to hang his picture on your refrigerator. Which means he will need…scotch tape.
He’ll hang up his drawing and stand back to look at it. Looking at the refrigerator will remind him that he’s thirsty so…he’ll ask for a glass of milk.
And chances are IF he asks for a glass of milk, he’s going to want a cookie to go with it.
At least live ASL is back – July 1 2020
As a kid I was always fascinated by the picture in picture oval of a live signer that accompanied some tv shows – usually religious in nature. In recent memory it seemed like that was a lost art, I suppose in thanks to the advanced technology of closed captions. So I have happily welcomed the return of the live signers who are an integral part of the COVID-19 updates being made by our supposed “leaders”. I am particularly impressed by the ability of signers for the leaders of our failing DNC controlled cities to so effectively emote the bleeding heart, reactive, weather vane like, mentalities of these mental midgets.
It’s a “lose-lose” for America – June 30 2020
In the U.S., our public schools, at best, do a mediocre job of teaching the basics. Almost all “outstanding” or even “good” students have outstanding parents and/or other supports – they are not a reflection of a great school or gifted educators. Our k-12 schools and almost all of our colleges and universities do a great job of teaching the victim/oppressor/marxist/socialist/equal outcomes/BLMLGBTQ agenda etc.
Our schools are failing, not as measured by the poor results many students earn on “high stakes” standardized tests, but in large part, because of those assessments. The preoccupation with these single snapshot measures creates a myopic focus on gaming that system and thereby hijacks the ability of educators to provide a comprehensive education of literacy, numeracy, arts, civics, and personal responsibility. Add to this the corrupting influence of our 100% leftist teachers unions and our children don’t have a chance. So most of our children leave school barely equipped to survive as functional adults, and with such a misguided indoctrination into the “free thinking” of the far left liberal mindset that for the American people it’s a lose-lose.
For this reason we need a new “Common Core” for the nation:
Personal responsibility
