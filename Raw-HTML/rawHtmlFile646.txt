They discuss Tremaine Edmunds doing what Patrick considers a pretty lousy job at middle linebacker and how much his injury or who’s playing in front of him is factoring in. They also discuss the ineffectiveness of the defensive line at generating sacks and pressure on quarterbacks, particularly Jerry Hughes, who is sackless and has just one tackle for a loss through five games.\n\nOn the offensive side of the balls the guys agree that John Brown was missed significantly more than they thought he’d be.  They also have takes on Devin Singletary, TJ Yeldon and if just one game does anything to diminish what Josh Allen has done so far this season.\n\nThey also a few minutes discussing the professional wrestling business slipping further into irrelevancy, bad NFL analysts, Patrick looking forward to Troy Aikman coming to Buffalo next week and the reaction from a surprised Joe as he learns about an upcoming election podcast he’ll be a part of.\n\nFollow Joe on Twitter @Buffalowins.

things have been over the past six months, the evolution of his podcast that’s become quite successful, the Buffalo Bills, Lebron vs Jordan, the public demise of Marc Miller and much more.\n\nMatt’s been a favorite guest of the podcast several times previously including live shows done over wings at Audubon North and Casey’s in Black Rock.  However, Matt hasn’t been on the podcast since back on episode No. 210 back in early April and Patrick spends time learning how life’s been for Matt during these weird and often trying times, including a discussion of how radically different the job of being a NFL team beat reporter has changed in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic.  That ranges from regular team coverage to interview as well as overall team access and Matt pulls back the curtain a little bit on what it’s been like.\n\nThey also spend time talking about the Shout Buffalo Football podcast Matt has started with his “tag team” partner at NYup.com, Ryan Talbot.  In less than six months the podcast has already grown by leaps and bounds especially on the video side, where their regular livestream shows often generate at least a few thousand people watching live on various platforms.  Matt describes the decision that went into the podcast, the process of how it’s done and reveals a few of his favorite episodes and guests he’s had on to this point.\n\nOf course, they also spend time discussing the Buffalo Bills, including their surprisingly (mostly) dominant opening month, Josh Allen’s emergence as a legitimate early season league MVP candidate, the struggles of the defense, injuries and concerns about the team competing against the Covid infested Tennessee Titans on Tuesday night.\n\nYou can follow Matt on Twitter @MattParrino and of course be sure to check out his work at NYup.com as well as subscribe to his podcast, which again is killing it.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter @PatMoranTweets for news on upcoming guests, contests and much

The Titans were never behind on the scoreboard, as they picked off Josh Allen twice on the day, and moved the ball effectively at this regressed defense.\n\nHowever, it's not time to panic, Bills fans. It was a strange week, uncertain that these two teams would even play. With the Titans COVID situation, which seems to have been found that they followed all protocols by the NFL, Buffalo was forced to game plan for two top teams in the AFC. Though there are flaws, it is only one game.\n\nTennessee had their way with the Bills defense, who was surprisingly missing several key pieces, including Tre White. There were several highlight reel plays against the Bills waning defense, especially the stiff arm of Josh Norman at the hands of Derrick Henry. The regression may have some folks calling for the removal of Leslie Frazier, if this season doesn't end the way that many believe it can; a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nThe Bills looked out of sync offensively as well, missing John Brown and Zach Moss. Despite Brown being out, who is unquestionably the number two wide receiver, second to Diggs, Cole Beasley received minimal looks, including no targets in the first half. It was a terrible performance on both sides of the ball.\n\nListen in as Bills Wire podcast hosts Matt and David take you through the night's action.","short":""},"durationInMilliseconds":2790000,"kind":"full","mediaKind":"audio","name":"Episode 5 - Bills blown out by Titans; Can they rebound against Chiefs?","releaseDateTime":"2020-10-14T12:37:28.000Z","url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-5-bills-blown-out-by-titans-can-they-rebound/id1281346577?i=1000494721295","websiteUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7705366"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember10497736"}}}},{"id":"1000493631589","type":"media/podcast-episode","attributes":{"genreNames":["Sports"],"contentRating":"clean","artistName":"The Bills Wire Daily Podcast","assetUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7697790.mp3?modified=1601870772\u0026source=rss\u0026stitched=1","description":{"standard":"Buffalo is off to a solid 4-0 start after a 30-23 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders Sunday. There were seldom any moments where the Bills team were at risk of losing control, and the Bills seemed relatively effective in all phases of the game.\n\nThe Bills quickly took control of the game, with two touchdowns in as many drives, with Josh Allen hitting Gabriel Davis and Cole Beasley for early scores, and a commanding 14-3 lead in the first quarter. Allen was successful in spreading the ball around to his various weapons again, a sign of Brian Daboll's play calling and ability to keep defenses uneasy on who to protect.\n\nVegas made things interesting, scoring a touchdown at the end of the first half, keeping things close for a possible Bills defensive collapse in the second half, as we have seen in the first three games. It never came to fruition however, despite the Raiders being able to push the chains.\n\nThe defense came alive in the fourth quarter, rallying behind returning Josh Norman, who played in his first game as a Bill. Norman was put on injured reserve and missed the first three weeks, but came up big and brought much needed energy to this defensive unit. The veteran corner back had a big fumble recovery after a hit on Darren Waller, and the Bills defense never looked back.\n\nAs of now, it is presumed that the Bills will play the 3-0 Tennessee Titans, but after a week of positive COVID tests, the game may be postponed. Depending on how the NFL decides to restructure the schedule, the Bills next opponents may be the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football in two weeks. Stay tuned to Bills Wire for those updates.\n\nRegardless, join Matt as he's joined by David De Cristofaro for this week's episode of the Bills Wire Billscast!","short":""},"durationInMilliseconds":3232000,"kind":"full","mediaKind":"audio","name":"Episode 4 - Bills dominate Raider; Titans or Chiefs next?","releaseDateTime":"2020-10-05T10:00:00.000Z","url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-4-bills-dominate-raider-titans-or-chiefs-next/id1281346577?i=1000493631589","websiteUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7697790"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember10497737"}}}},{"id":"1000492831931","type":"media/podcast-episode","attributes":{"genreNames":["Sports"],"contentRating":"clean","artistName":"The Bills Wire Daily Podcast","assetUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7692801.mp3?modified=1601298043\u0026source=rss\u0026stitched=1","description":{"standard":"The Buffalo Bills left us with another nail biter finish this week, as they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 35 - 32 in Orchard Park. After a 28 - 3 deficit early in the third quarter, the Rams rallied back to challenge the Bills, scoring 29 unanswered points, but could not finish the game on top.\n\nIt certainly left many scratching their heads, as the phrase \"28 - 3\" is not one that is kindly used on the team with 28 points. The Bills however, avoided that ugly stigma with another incredible, yet roller coaster ride of a fourth quarter comeback. The Bills now have three wins in as many weeks, with a road trip to Las Vegas to play the Raiders next week.\n\nThere are certainly some questions about this Bills defense, and the scheme being used after they jumped to the massive lead that they did. How could a team that was ranked in the top five last year, allow such a comeback? It is certainly worrisome, as this has put Josh Allen and the offense in unnecessarily challenging predicaments the last several weeks. The defense has to get back to last year's form, or there could be many near - heart attack finishes like this.\n\nAllen continues to earn a solid reputation amongst his fans and even his biggest critics. Allen has thrown for 300+ yards in every game this year, and it isn't too far - fetched to start mentioning Allen in the MVP discussion yet. It's still early, and there's lots of great football yet, but he's playing as great as any elite quarterback in the NFL right now!","short":""},"durationInMilliseconds":1616000,"kind":"full","mediaKind":"audio","name":"Episode 3 - Bills overcome second half woes to hold off the Rams","releaseDateTime":"2020-09-28T15:00:00.000Z","url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-3-bills-overcome-second-half-woes-to-hold-off/id1281346577?i=1000492831931","websiteUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7692801"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember10497738"}}}},{"id":"1000492009846","type":"media/podcast-episode","attributes":{"genreNames":["Sports"],"contentRating":"clean","artistName":"The Bills Wire Daily Podcast","assetUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7687556.mp3?modified=1600696572\u0026source=rss\u0026stitched=1","description":{"standard":"While it was a bit of nail biter, a few Buffalo Bills had career days against the rebuilding Miami Dolphins. with a 31 - 28 victory coming down to the final moments of the game. Despite having some injuries at the linebacker position, the defense did just enough to give the offense ample opportunity to win the game.\n\nJosh Allen and Stefon Diggs led the team statistically, with Josh Allen crossing the 400+ yards passing milestone, with 4 touchdowns and no turnovers. Diggs hauled in 153 of those yards and an untelevisied touchdown. John Brown and company had solid showings as well, as Allen continued to spread the ball around to his teammates.\n\nAgain, the game wasn't as one sided as the stats might seem. The Dolphins game planned wisely for the banged up linebacker group, and Fitzpatrick wisely fed tight end Mike Gesicki for a 100+ yard day. The ability of the Dolphins to attack the middle of the field, kept the game closer than it should have.\n\nNext week, the Bills return home to play the Los Angeles Rams, who find themselves undefeated as well after victories over the Cowboys and Eagles. There is some area for concern if Tremaine Edmunds and Matt Milano, amongst others, remain out for this big Week 3 match up.","short":""},"durationInMilliseconds":1086000,"kind":"full","mediaKind":"audio","name":"Episode 2 - Bills route Dolphins; Can they keep up the Momentum against Rams?","releaseDateTime":"2020-09-21T15:00:00.000Z","url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-2-bills-route-dolphins-can-they-keep-up-momentum/id1281346577?i=1000492009846","websiteUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7687556"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember10497739"}}}},{"id":"1000491185357","type":"media/podcast-episode","attributes":{"genreNames":["Sports"],"contentRating":"clean","artistName":"The Bills Wire Daily Podcast","assetUrl":"https://audioboom.com/posts/7681585.mp3?modified=1600041104\u0026source=rss\u0026stitched=1","description":{"standard":"The Bills and Jets went head to head in Week 1 of NFL action. It was pretty one - sided for most of the game, with the Bills taking a 21-0 lead in the first half, and the Jets unable to muster much.\n\nThe Bills did have a few, very forgivable mistakes today, with fumbles and missed field goals, but behind Josh Allen's first 300+ yard passing game, and 2 TD's by air, and one of his own on the ground. It was a nice day for Allen who set a personal best in yards thrown and completions. Allen succeeded well in getting the ball around to many of the weapons that Buffalo has acquired for him.\n\nThe Defense had a nice showing, sending the Jets to several three and out drives in the first half. They did go into a more conservative style defense in the second half, allowing for the Jets to rally, but had the game firmly in control from start to finish.  \n\nBuffalo is set to face off with the Dolphins next week, who are coming off of a loss against the Patriots.

While the world is certainly still not \"back to normal\", the NFL returning will certainly be a welcome step by many towards enjoying sports, with or without fans in the various stadiums.\n\nAfter a week of Training Camp, and some practices in pads, the Bills have had a relatively quiet camp, due in part to new regulations on what outside media is allowed to report while observing practices, as well as, Buffalo as an organization and a fan base, feeling pretty confident this year. Continuity has served the Bills well this off season, and there are more answers, than questions, for the seemingly first time, in a long time. A quiet camp is good news as far as we're concerned.\n\nNow that the season is a mere few weeks however, and we have a better idea on how this team, and several opponents are looking for 2020, Matt's  decided to hit his Win/Loss predictions now, and if the Bills can put everything together with this talented roster, respected and seasoned coaching staff, and nearly flawless front office, the Lombardi Trophy might not be so far out of reach in 2020. Despite a collision course with the NFC and AFC West, as well as encounters with fellow second place AFC Teams, Buffalo has done well to establish itself as one of the premier teams in the NFL, and are still generally favored for success.\n\nAlso, what would a season outlook be without some expectations?
