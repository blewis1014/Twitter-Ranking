He covers tips for digital security in your everyday life, particularly if you are organizing online, and then we also go over tips for how to protect yourself in the streets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson recently did a similar episode on their podcast, Coffee with Comrades (link below), which we also highly recommend! The CrimethInc link below also has great information in writing in one place as an additional reference. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity culture: a security culture is a set of customs shared by a community whose members may be targeted by the government, designed to minimize risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Episode 92: “Practice Safe Sec” (Coffee with Comrades)* CrimethInc definition of security culture (Crimethinc.com)* Jail And Court Support (Rebel Steps Podcast)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT THE SHOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us: Twitter | Instagram |YouTube \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our community: Facebook Group | Discord Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate to us: Patreon | PayPal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n028 Let’s Talk About Sec, Baby!.mp3Nichole [00:00:26] Hi, everyone.

A lot of people have a lot of different feelings and perspectives on what “socialism,” “communism,” and “anarchism” mean. Plenty of folks simply regurgitate whatever they hear on social media—for good or ill. Others actually take the time to read the theory. Some of those folks form their own perspectives and insights, while a good chunk of others just follow a party-line. Don’t take my word for things here. This episode series is meant to serve as a very brief introduction to each of these rich, vast, and complex ideological positions. So, take everything I have to say here with a grain of salt, read and explore these theories for yourself, and—most importantly—use these ideas to improve the lives and material conditions of your friends, family, neighbors, and comrades.\n That said, this discussion of communism did get the stamp-of-approval from one of my Marxist-Leninist comrades so, take that for whatever it’s worth.\n Also, if you think it would be helpful, you can check out the PowerPoints for each of these introductory philosophical episodes. \n PowerPoints:\n   Socialism  Communism  Anarchism  Notes:\n  Support Coffee with Comrades on Patreon, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and visit our website.

The good news is we’ve done just that! Last year, I sat down with some friends and comrades in the Center for Participant Education to outline, in broad strokes, the differences between socialism, communism, and anarchism. What you’ll hear today is the first of those dialogues. This edition of the podcast is all about the economics, politics, and philosophical perspectives of socialism as it is broadly construed. I talk about Marxism, labor, and try to distinguish socialism from communism.\n Keep in mind, this is all coming from someone who falls pretty firmly into anarchic tendencies, so take everything I have to say with a grain of salt. I encourage you, first and foremost, to investigate different positions on the revolutionary left for yourself and think critically about these ideas so that you can come up with you own convictions and conceptions. Just the same, I hope this mini-series paints each of these distinct philosophies in a fair, clear, and concise light so that you can hopefully begin to understand and distinguish the differences between these complex and complicated philosophies.\n Also, if you think it would be helpful, you can check out the PowerPoints for each of these introductory philosophical episodes. \n PowerPoints:\n   Socialism  Communism  Anarchism  Notes:\n  Support Coffee with Comrades on Patreon, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and visit our website.
