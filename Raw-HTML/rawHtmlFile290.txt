class="">During an acrimonious exchange, the president defended the low tax bill he is reported to have paid by suggesting that if Biden wanted him to have not taken advantage of the tax code, he should have acted to fix it during his tenure in the Senate.</p><p class="">"The tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than a schoolteacher is because of — he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code," Biden said.</p><p class="">Trump replied: "But why didn't you do it over the last 25 years? Why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?"</p><p class="">In reality, despite being in Senate for 36 years, Biden was never technically in a position to rewrite the federal tax code.</p><p class="">While in the Senate from 1973 to 2009, Biden was chair of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees and had no direct hand in writing tax laws. That's the job of the Finance Committee.</p><p class="">Trump, on the other hand, takes advantage of several loopholes to avoid paying taxes, including some for which he personally lobbied. </p><p class="">Among them is a law passed in 1986 to limit investors not actively involved in a business from taking deductions and attributing losses against their incomes. An "at risk" rule was also added to prevent taxpayers from deducting losses greater than their investments. But Congress largely exempted real estate developers, like Trump.</p><p class="">At the same time that his investments in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were suffering, <a

class="">During an acrimonious exchange, the president defended the low tax bill he is reported to have paid by suggesting that if Biden wanted him to have not taken advantage of the tax code, he should have acted to fix it during his tenure in the Senate.</p><p class="">"The tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than a schoolteacher is because of — he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code," Biden said.</p><p class="">Trump replied: "But why didn't you do it over the last 25 years? Why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?"</p><p class="">In reality, despite being in Senate for 36 years, Biden was never technically in a position to rewrite the federal tax code.</p><p class="">While in the Senate from 1973 to 2009, Biden was chair of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees and had no direct hand in writing tax laws. That's the job of the Finance Committee.</p><p class="">Trump, on the other hand, takes advantage of several loopholes to avoid paying taxes, including some for which he personally lobbied. </p><p class="">Among them is a law passed in 1986 to limit investors not actively involved in a business from taking deductions and attributing losses against their incomes. An "at risk" rule was also added to prevent taxpayers from deducting losses greater than their investments. But Congress largely exempted real estate developers, like Trump.</p><p class="">At the same time that his investments in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were suffering, <a href="https://youtu.be/AXO2936XM9w?t=683">Trump appeared before Congress in 1991 to advocate for "tax shelters"</a> that would "incentivize" "investment in real estate" to help boost the economy
