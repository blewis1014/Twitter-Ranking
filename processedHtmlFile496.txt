Medical assistant sues Houston, Texas clinics over unpaid wages
Wednesday morning, on the second day of early voting in Texas, the billboard appeared to have been vandalized with the words "TAKE ... TO PRISON" painted around the president's name.
"Every day I have to look at it (on my way to work) … and then this past morning I looked at it and I did a double-take," Garcia said.
Garcia's photo of the defaced billboard went viral on Twitter, earning nearly 60,000 likes in less than a day. It also sparked similar viral posts on Reddit. 
“While Joe Biden refuses to denounce vandalism and destruction of property across the nation, Texans know President Trump will have their back and uphold the rule of law," Trump Victory Spokesperson Samantha Cotten said in an email to the Houston Chronicle.
Social media reacted with its usual conflicting viewpoints.
Isn’t it a crime to deface a campaign sign? If we’re ever going to get back to a civil society, both sides have to cut this kind of stuff our.

Is it wrong to be pleased with vandalism? I'm conflicted. Lol
Defacing private property is illegal, of course, and Garcia said the person or persons responsible could face a misdemeanor charge with a fine that would cover the cost of the damage.
"They could bump it to a state jail felony," Garcia said.
A spokesperson for the Houston Police Department found no reports of vandalism regarding the billboard as of Thursday afternoon.
This week marked the start of early voting in Texas, with record numbers of voters heading to the polls in Houston and across the state. Within the first day, Texas surpassed one million votes ; Harris County recorded more than 125,000 ballots cast, a record turnout compared to the 2016 election.
