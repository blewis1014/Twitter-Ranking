The idea of setting up the Metro-3 car shed at Kanjurmarg, as announced by
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray
, had already been rejected by an expert committee set up by the
MVA government
said on Wednesday. Thackeray had on Sunday announced relocation of the car shed from
Aarey Colony
and said Kanjurmarg land will be available at zero rate for the project.
In a series of tweets, Fadnavis alleged that the government has betrayed the
citizens of Mumbai
by shifting the car shed site and alleged that due to this, the project will be delayed by four-and a-half years.
Following his intervention, two environmentalists, Zoru Bhathena and D Stalin, challenged the former CM for a debate on the issue.
“It was this citizens’ movement that resulted in your government appointing a Technical Committee, in 2015, to look into the issue of the conservation of Aarey… It was this very
Technical Committee
that accepted the alternate Kanjurmarg plot, as suggested by citizens… The present government has now accepted the near same proposal from 2015, with minor positive tweaks,” they said.
